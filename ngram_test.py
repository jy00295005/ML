Gram-negative organisms are slightly less susceptible than gram-positive bacteria. A number of EO components has been identified as effective antibacterials, e.g. carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, perillaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid, having minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.05-5 mul ml(-1) in vitro. A higher concentration is needed to achieve the same effect in foods. Studies with fresh meat, meat products, fish, milk, dairy products, vegetables, fruit and cooked rice have shown that the concentration needed to achieve a significant antibacterial effect is around 0.5-20 mul g(-1) in foods and about 0.1-10 mul ml-1 in solutions for washing fruit and vegetables. EOs comprise a large number of components and it is likely that their mode of action involves several targets in the bacterial cell. The hydrophobicity of EOs enables them to partition in the lipids of the cell membrane and mitochondria, rendering them permeable and leading to leakage of cell contents. Physical conditions that improve the action of EOs are low pH, low temperature and low oxygen levels. Synergism has been observed between carvacrol and its precursor p-cyrnene and between cinnamaidehyde and eugenol. Synergy between EO components and mild preservation methods has also been observed. Some EO components are legally registered flavourings in the EU and the USA. Undesirable organoleptic effects can be limited by careful selection of EOs according to the type of food.

	"THREE-FLAVOUR NEUTRINO OSCILLATION UPDATE || We review the present status of three-flavour neutrino oscillations, taking into account the latest available neutrino oscillation data presented at the Neutrino 2008 Conference. This includes the data released this summer by the MINOS collaboration, the data of the neutral current counter phase of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) solar neutrino experiment, as well as the latest KamLAND and Borexino data. We give the updated determinations of the leading 'solar' and 'atmospheric' oscillation parameters. We find from global data that the mixing angle theta(13) is consistent with zero within 0.9 sigma and we derive an upper bound of sin(2)theta(13) <= 0.035 (0.056) at 90% confidence level (CL) (3 sigma). && PRECISION MEASUREMENT OF NEUTRINO OSCILLATION PARAMETERS WITH KAMLAND || The KamLAND experiment has determined a precise value for the neutrino oscillation parameter Delta m(21)(2) and stringent constraints on theta(12). The exposure to nuclear reactor antineutrinos is increased almost fourfold over previous results to 2.44x10(32) proton yr due to longer livetime and an enlarged fiducial volume. An undistorted reactor (nu) over bar (e) energy spectrum is now rejected at > 5 sigma. Analysis of the reactor spectrum above the inverse beta decay energy threshold, and including geoneutrinos, gives a best fit at Delta m(21)(2)=7.58(-0.13)(+0.14)(stat)(-0.15)(+0.15)(syst) x 10(-5) eV(2) and tan(2)theta(12)=0.56(-0.07)(+0.10)(stat)(-0.06)(+0.10)(syst). Local Delta chi(2) minima at higher and lower Delta m(21)(2) are disfavored at > 4 sigma. Combining with solar neutrino data, we obtain Delta m(21)(2)=7.59(-0.21)(+0.21) x 10(-5) eV(2) and tan(2)theta(12)=0.47(-0.05)(+0.06). && HINTS OF THETA(13) > 0 FROM GLOBAL NEUTRINO DATA ANALYSIS || Nailing down the unknown neutrino mixing angle theta(13) is one of the most important goals in current lepton physics. In this context, we perform a global analysis of neutrino oscillation data, focusing on theta(13), and including recent results [Neutrino 2008, Proceedings of the XXIII International Conference on Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics, Christchurch, New Zealand, 2008 (unpublished)]. We discuss two converging hints of theta(13) > 0, each at the level of similar to 1 sigma: an older one coming from atmospheric neutrino data, and a newer one coming from the combination of solar and long-baseline reactor neutrino data. Their combination provides the global estimate sin2 theta(13) 0: 016 +/- 0.010(1 sigma), implying a preference for theta(13) > 0 with non-negligible statistical significance (similar to 90% C.L.). We discuss possible refinements of the experimental data analyses, which might sharpen such intriguing indications. && SEARCH FOR ELECTRON NEUTRINO APPEARANCE AT THE DELTA M(2)SIMILAR TO 1 EV(2) SCALE || The MiniBooNE Collaboration reports first results of a search for nu(e) appearance in a nu(mu) beam. With two largely independent analyses, we observe no significant excess of events above the background for reconstructed neutrino energies above 475 MeV. The data are consistent with no oscillations within a two-neutrino appearance-only oscillation model. && NEUTRINO MASS AND NEW PHYSICS || We review the present state and future outlook of our understanding of neutrino masses and mixings. We discuss what we think are the most important perspectives on the plausible and natural scenarios for neutrinos and attempt to throw light onto the. flavor problem of quarks and leptons. This review focuses on the see-saw mechanism, which fits into a big picture of particle physics such as supersymmetry and grand unification, providing a unified approach to the flavor problem of quarks and leptons. We argue that, in combination with family symmetries, this may be at the heart of a unified understanding of the flavor puzzle. We also discuss other new, physics ideas, such as neutrinos in models with extra dimensions, and possible theoretical implications of sterile neutrinos. We outline some tests for the various schemes. && THEORY OF NEUTRINOS: A WHITE PAPER || This paper is a review of the present status of neutrino mass physics, which grew out of an APS sponsored study of neutrinos in 2004. After a discussion of the present knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing and some popular ways to probe the new physics implied by recent data, it summarizes what can be learned about neutrino interactions as well as the nature of new physics beyond the Standard Model from the various proposed neutrino experiments. The intriguing possibility that neutrino mass physics may be at the heart of our understanding of a long standing puzzle of cosmology, i.e. the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry is also discussed. && A(4) FAMILY SYMMETRY AND QUARK-LEPTON UNIFICATION || We present a model of quark and lepton masses and mixings based on A(4) family symmetry, a discrete subgroup of an SO(3) flavour symmetry, together with Pati-Salam unification. It accommodates tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing via constrained sequential dominance with a particularly simple vacuum alignment mechanism emerging through the effective D-term contributions to the scalar potential. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. && TRI-BIMAXIMAL NEUTRINO MIXING AND QUARK MASSES FROM A DISCRETE FLAVOUR SYMMETRY || We build a supersymmetric model of quark and lepton masses based on the discrete flavour symmetry group T', the double covering of A(4). In the lepton sector our model is practically indistinguishable from recent models based on A(4) and, in particular, it predicts a nearly tri-bimaximal mixing, in good agreement with present data. In the quark sector a realistic pattern of masses and mixing angles is obtained by exploiting the doublet representations of T' not available in A(4). To this purpose, the flavour symmetry T' should be broken spontaneously along appropriate directions in flavour space. In this paper we fully discuss the related vacuum alignment problem, both at the leading order and by accounting for small effects coming from higher-order corrections. As a result we get the relations: root(m(d)/m(s)) over bar approximate to \V-us\ and root(m(d)/m(s)) over bar approximate to \V-td/V-ts\. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved. && SOLAR NEUTRINO MEASUREMENTS IN SUPER-KAMIOKANDE-I || The details of Super-Kamiokande-I's solar neutrino analysis are given. Solar neutrino measurement in Super-Kamiokande is a high statistics collection of B-8 solar neutrinos via neutrino-electron scattering. The analysis method and results of the 1496 day data sample are presented. The final oscillation results for the data are presented also. && MEASUREMENT OF NEUTRINO OSCILLATIONS WITH THE MINOS DETECTORS IN THE NUMI BEAM || This Letter reports new results from the MINOS experiment based on a two-year exposure to muon neutrinos from the Fermilab NuMI beam. Our data are consistent with quantum-mechanical oscillations of neutrino flavor with mass splitting vertical bar Delta m(2)vertical bar = (2.43 +/- 0.13) x 10(-3) eV(2) (68% C.L.) and mixing angle sin(2)(2 theta) > 0.90 (90% C.L.). Our data disfavor two alternative explanations for the disappearance of neutrinos in flight: namely, neutrino decays into lighter particles and quantum decoherence of neutrinos, at the 3.7 and 5.7 standard-deviation levels, respectively. && TRI-BIMAXIMAL NEUTRINO MIXING FROM ORBIFOLDING || We show that the A(4) discrete symmetry that naturally leads to tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing can be simply obtained as a result of an orbifolding starting from a model in 6 dimensions. This particular orbifolding has four fixed points where 4-dimensional branes are located and the tetrahedral symmetry of A(4) connects these branes. In this approach A(4) appears after the reduction from six to four dimensions as a remnant of the 6D space-time symmetry. A previously discussed supersymmetric version of A(4) is reinterpreted along these lines. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. && CKM AND TRI-BIMAXIMAL MNS MATRICES IN A SU(5) X T-(D) MODEL || We propose a model based on SU(5) x T-(d) which successfully gives rise to near tri-bimaximal leptonic mixing as well as realistic CKM matrix elements for the quarks. The Georgi-Jarlskog relations for three generations are also obtained. Due to the (d) T transformation property of the matter fields, the b-quark mass can be generated only when the (d) T symmetry is broken, giving a dynamical origin for the hierarchy between m(b) and m(t). There are only nine operators allowed in the Yukawa sector up to at least mass dimension seven due to an additional Z(12) x Z'(21) symmetry, which also forbids, up to some high orders, operators that lead to proton decay. The resulting model has a total of nine parameters in the charged fermion and neutrino sectors, and hence is very predictive. In addition to the prediction for theta(13) similar or equal to theta(c)/3 root 2, the model gives rise to a sum rule, tan(2) theta(circle dot) similar or equal to tan(2) theta(circle dot,) TBM -1/2 theta(c) cos beta, which is a consequence of the Georgi-Jarlskog relations in the quark sector. This deviation could account for the difference between the experimental best fit value for the solar mixing angle and the value predicted by the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix.(c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. && DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF THE BE-7 SOLAR NEUTRINO FLUX WITH 192 DAYS OF BOREXINO DATA || We report the direct measurement of the 7 Be solar neutrino signal rate performed with the Borexino detector at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. The interaction rate of the 0.862 MeV Be-7 neutrinos is 49 +/- 3(stat) +/- 4(syst) counts/(day . 100 ton). The hypothesis of no oscillation for Be-7 solar neutrinos is inconsistent with our measurement at the 4 sigma C.L. Our result is the first direct measurement of the survival probability for solar P, in the transition region between matter-enhanced and vacuum-driven oscillations. The measurement improves the experimental determination of the flux of Be-7, pp, and CNO solar v(e) and the limit on the effective neutrino magnetic moment using solar neutrinos. && S-3 SYMMETRY AND TRI-BIMAXIMAL MIXING || The near maximal value for the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle together with the fact that the solar mixing angle satisfies the relation sin(2) theta circle dot similar or equal to 1/3 is the basis for the so-called tri-bimaximal mixing when theta(13) = 0. In this Letter, we explore the possibility that tri-bimaximal mixing is an indication of a softly broken higher leptonic symmetry S-3, the permutation of three lepton families that embeds the mu-tau exchange symmetry of leptons. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V. && INDICATION OF ELECTRON NEUTRINO APPEARANCE FROM AN ACCELERATOR-PRODUCED OFF-AXIS MUON NEUTRINO BEAM || The T2K experiment observes indications of nu(mu) -> nu(mu) e appearance in data accumulated with 1.43 x 10(20) protons on target. Six events pass all selection criteria at the far detector. In a three-flavor neutrino oscillation scenario with |Delta m(23)(2)| = 2.4 x 10(-3) eV(2), sin(2)2 theta(23) = 1 and sin(2)2 theta(13) = 0, the expected number of such events is 1.5 +/- 0.3(syst). Under this hypothesis, the probability to observe six or more candidate events is 7 x 10(-3), equivalent to 2.5 sigma significance. At 90% C.L., the data are consistent with 0.03(0.04) < sin(2)2 theta(13) < 0.28(0.34) for delta(CP) = 0 and a normal (inverted) hierarchy. && INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENT OF THE TOTAL ACTIVE B-8 SOLAR NEUTRINO FLUX USING AN ARRAY OF HE-3 PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS AT THE SUDBURY NEUTRINO OBSERVATORY || The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) used an array of He-3 proportional counters to measure the rate of neutral-current interactions in heavy water and precisely determined the total active (nu(x)) B-8 solar neutrino flux. This technique is independent of previous methods employed by SNO. The total flux is found to be 5.54(-0.31)(+0.33)(stat)(-0.34)(+0.36)(syst) x 10(6) cm(-2) s(-1), in agreement with previous measurements and standard solar models. A global analysis of solar and reactor neutrino results yields Delta m(2) = 7.59(-0.21)(+0.19) x 10(-5) eV(2) and theta = 34.4(-1.2)(+1.3) degrees. The uncertainty on the mixing angle has been reduced from SNO's previous results. && NEUTRINO TRI-BI-MAXIMAL MIXING FROM A NON-ABELIAN DISCRETE FAMILY SYMMETRY || The observed neutrino mixing, having a near maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing angle and a large solar mixing angle, is close to tribi-maximal. We argue that this structure suggests a family symmetric origin in which the magnitude of the mixing angles are related to the existence of a discrete non-Abelian family symmetry. We construct a model in which the family symmetry is the non-Abelian discrete group Delta(27), a subgroup of SU(3) in which the tri-bi-maximal mixing directly follows from the vacuum structure enforced by the discrete symmetry. In addition to the lepton mixing angles, the model accounts for the observed quark and lepton masses and the CKM matrix. The structure is also consistent with an underlying stage of Grand Unification. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. && RIGHT-HANDED NEUTRINOS AT CERN LHC AND THE MECHANISM OF NEUTRINO MASS GENERATION || We consider the possibility to detect right-handed neutrinos, which are mostly singlets of the standard model gauge group, at future accelerators. Substantial mixing of these neutrinos with the active neutrinos requires a cancellation of different contributions to the light neutrino mass matrix at the level of 10(-8). We discuss possible symmetries behind this cancellation and argue that for three right-handed neutrinos they always lead to conservation of total lepton number. Light neutrino masses can be generated by small perturbations violating these symmetries. In the most general case, LHC physics and the mechanism of neutrino mass generation are essentially decoupled; with additional assumptions, correlations can appear between collider observables and features of the neutrino mass matrix. && MODEL FOR FERMION MASSES AND LEPTON MIXING IN SO(10) X A(4) || The discrete flavor symmetry A(4) explains very well neutrino data at low energy, but it seems difficult to extend it to grand unified models since, in general, left-handed and right-handed fields belong to different A(4) representations. Recently a model has been proposed where all the fermions equally transform under A(4). We study here a concrete SO(10) realization of such a model providing small neutrino masses through the see-saw mechanism. We fit the charged fermion masses run up to the unification scale. Some fermion masses properties come from the SO(10) symmetry while lepton mixing angles are a consequence of the A(4) properties. Moreover, our model predicts the absolute value of the neutrino masses; these are in the range m(nu)similar or equal to 0.005-0.052 eV. && STERILE NEUTRINO OSCILLATIONS AFTER FIRST MINIBOONE RESULTS || In view of the recent results from the MiniBooNE experiment we revisit the global neutrino oscillation fit to short-baseline neutrino data by adding one or two sterile neutrinos with eV-scale masses to the three standard model neutrinos, and for the first time we consider also the global fit with three sterile neutrinos. Four-neutrino oscillations of the (3+1) type have been only marginally allowed before the recent MiniBooNE results, and become even more disfavored with the new data (at the level of 4 sigma). In the framework of so-called (3+2) five-neutrino mass schemes we find severe tension between appearance and disappearance experiments at the level of more than 3 sigma, and hence no satisfactory fit to the global data is possible in (3+2) schemes. This tension remains also when a third sterile neutrino is added, and the quality of the global fit does not improve significantly in a (3+3) scheme. It should be noted, however, that in models with more than one sterile neutrino the MiniBooNE results are in perfect agreement with the appearance evidence reported by the LSND Collaboration, thanks to the possibility of CP violation available in such oscillation schemes. Furthermore, if disappearance data are not taken into account (3+2) oscillations provide an excellent fit to the full MiniBooNE spectrum including the event excess at low energies. && DISTINGUISHING SEESAW MODELS AT LHC WITH MULTI-LEPTON SIGNALS || We investigate the LHC discovery potential for electroweak scale heavy neutrino singlets (seesaw I), scalar triplets (seesaw II) and fermion triplets (seesaw III). For seesaw I we consider a heavy Majorana neutrino coupling to the electron or muon. For seesaw II we concentrate on the likely scenario where the new scalars decay to two leptons. For seesaw III we restrict ourselves to heavy Majorana fermion triplets decaying to light leptons plus gauge or Higgs bosons, which are dominant except for unnaturally small mixings. The possible signals are classified in terms of the charged lepton multiplicity, studying nine A different final states ranging from one to six charged leptons. Using a fast detector simulation of signals II and backgrounds, it is found that the trilepton channel l(+/-)l(+/-)l(+/-) is by far the best one for scalar triplet discovery, and for fermion triplets it is as good as the like-sign dilepton channel l(+/-)l(+/-). For heavy neutrinos with a mass O(100) GeV, this trilepton channel is also better than the usually studied like-sign dilepton mode. In addition to evaluating the discovery potential, we make special emphasis on the discrimination among seesaw models if a positive signal is observed. This could be accomplished not only by searching for signals in different final states. but also by reconstructing the mass and determining the charge of the new resonances, which is possible in several cases. For high luminosities, further evidence is provided by the analysis of the production angular distributions in the cleanest channels with three or four leptons. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. && TRI-BIMAXIMAL NEUTRINO MIXING AND THE FAMILY SYMMETRY Z(7) X Z(3) || The non-Abelian finite group PSL2(7) is the only simple subgroup of SU(3) with a complex three-dimensional irreducible representation. It has two maximal subgroups, S-4 which, along with its own A(4) subgroup, has been successfully applied in numerous models of flavor, as well as the 21 element Frobenius group Z(7) x Z(3), which has gained much less attention. We show that it can also be used to generate tri-bimaximal mixing in the neutrino sector, while allowing for quark and charged lepton hierarchies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. && UPDATED GLOBAL FIT TO THREE NEUTRINO MIXING: STATUS OF THE HINTS OF THETA(13) > 0 || We present an up-to-date global analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrino data in the frame work of three-neutrino oscillations. We discuss in detail the statistical significance of the observed  && SUITABILITY OF A(4) AS A FAMILY SYMMETRY IN GRAND UNIFICATION || In the recent successful applications of the non-Abelian discrete symmetry A(4) to the tribimaximal mixing of neutrinos, lepton doublets and singlets do not transform in the same way. It thus appears to be unsuitable as a family symmetry in grand unification. A simple resolution of this dilemma is proposed. && NEUTRINO MASSES AND THE CERN LHC: TESTING THE TYPE II SEESAW MECHANISM || We demonstrate how to systematically test a well-motivated mechanism for neutrino mass generation (type II seesaw) at the LHC, in which a Higgs triplet is introduced. In the optimistic scenarios with a small Higgs triplet vacuum expectation value v(Delta) < 10(-4) GeV, one can look for clean signals of lepton-number violation in the decays of doubly charged (H-+/-+/-) and singly charged (H-+/-) Higgs bosons to distinguish the normal hierarchy (NH), the inverted hierarchy (IH), and the quasidegenerate (QD) spectrum for the light neutrino masses. The observation of either H+ -> tau(+)(nu) over bar or H+ -> e(+)(nu) over bar will be particularly robust for the spectrum test since they are independent of the unknown Majorana phases. The H++ decays moderately depend on a Majorana phase Phi(2) in the NH, but sensitively depend on Phi(1) in the IH. In a less favorable scenario v(Delta) > 2 x 10(-4) GeV, when the leptonic channels are suppressed, one needs to observe the decays H+ -> W+H1 and H+ -> t (b) over bar to confirm the triplet-doublet mixing which in turn implies the existence of the same gauge-invariant interaction between the lepton doublet and the Higgs triplet responsible for the neutrino mass generation. In the most optimistic situation, v(Delta) similar to 10(-4) GeV, both channels of the lepton pairs and gauge boson pairs may be available simultaneously. The determination of their relative branching fractions would give a measurement for the value of v(Delta). && UNIQUE HORIZONTAL SYMMETRY OF LEPTONS || There is a group-theoretical connection between fermion mixing matrices and minimal horizontal symmetry groups. Applying this connection to the tribimaximal neutrino mixing matrix, we show that the minimal horizontal symmetry group for leptons is uniquely S-4, the permutation group of four objects. && EVENT EXCESS IN THE MINIBOONE SEARCH FOR (NU)OVER-BAR(MU) -> (NU)OVER-BAR(E) OSCILLATIONS || The MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab reports results from a search for (nu) over bar (mu) -> (nu) over bar (e) oscillations, using a data sample corresponding to 5.66 x 10(20) protons on target. An excess of 20.9 +/- 14.0 events is observed in the energy range 475 < E-nu(QE) < 1250 MeV, which, when constrained by the observed <(nu)over bar>(mu) events, has a probability for consistency with the background-only hypothesis of 0.5%. On the other hand, fitting for (nu) over bar (mu) -> (nu) over bar (e) oscillations, the best-fit point has chi(2) probability of 8.7%. The data are consistent with (nu) over bar (mu) -> (nu) over bar (e) oscillations in the 0.1 to 1.0 eV(2) Delta m(2) range and with the evidence for antineutrino oscillations from the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector at Los Alamos National Laboratory. && NON-ABELIAN DISCRETE SYMMETRIES IN PARTICLE PHYSICS || We review pedagogically non-Abelian discrete groups, which play an important role in particle physics. We show group-theoretical aspects for many concrete groups, such as representations and their tensor products. We explain how to derive, conjugacy classes, characters, representations, and tensor products for these groups (with a finite number). We discuss them explicitly for S-N, A(N), T', D-N, Q(N), E(2N(2)), Delta(3N(2)), T-7, Sigma(3N(3)), and Delta(6N(2)), which have been applied for model building in particle physics. We also present typical flavor models by using A(4), S-4, and Delta(54) groups. Breaking patterns of discrete groups and decompositions of multiplets are important for applications of the non-Abelian discrete symmetry. We discuss these breaking patterns of the non-Abelian discrete group, which are a powerful tool for model buildings. We also review briefly anomalies of non-Abelian discrete symmetries by using the path integral approach. && UNEXPLAINED EXCESS OF ELECTRONLIKE EVENTS FROM A 1-GEV NEUTRINO BEAM || The MiniBooNE Collaboration observes unexplained electronlike events in the reconstructed neutrino energy range from 200 to 475 MeV. With 6.46 x 10(20) protons on target, 544 electronlike events are observed in this energy range, compared to an expectation of 415.2 +/- 43.4 events, corresponding to an excess of 128.8 +/- 20.4 +/- 38.3 events. The shape of the excess in several kinematic variables is consistent with being due to either nu(e) and (nu) over bar (e) charged-current scattering or nu(mu) neutral-current scattering with a photon in the final state. No significant excess of events is observed in the reconstructed neutrino energy range from 475 to 1250 MeV, where 408 events are observed compared to an expectation of 385.9 +/- 35.7 events. && DEVIATION FROM TRI-BIMAXIMAL NEUTRINO MIXING IN A(4) FLAVOR SYMMETRY || Tri-bimaximal mixing is a good approximation for the present data of neutrino mixing angles. The deviation from tri-bimaximal mixing is discussed numerically in the framework of the A(4) model. Values of tan(2) theta(12), sin(2) 2 theta(23) and vertical bar U-e3 vertical bar deviate from tri-bimaximal mixing due to the corrections of the vacuum alignment of flavon fields. It is noted that sin(2) 2 theta(23) deviates negligibly from 1 while sin(2) theta(12) can deviate from 1/3 considerably and sin theta(13) can be near the present experimental upper bound. The CP violating measure J(CP) and the effective Majorana neutrino mass < m(ee)> are also discussed. && PHENOMENOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE SEESAW MECHANISM IN S-4 BASED MODELS || Reference [1] proposed a flavor model based on the symmetry group S-4, managing to describe fermion masses and mixings. The Weinberg operator has been used in order to provide the smallness of the neutrino masses, while a set of scalar fields, getting nonvanishing vacuum expectation values, spontaneously breaks down S-4 and provides the tri-bimaximal pattern as the lepton mixing matrix. Restricting to this setting, in this paper we analyze possible origins for the effective terms: the type I seesaw mechanism is the best known approach, but type II and III are also discussed. The phenomenology related to these models is various and future experiments could in principle discriminate among these proposals. Furthermore, we compare our realizations to two relevant A(4) based models, also predicting the tri-bimaximal lepton mixing, and we find that an analysis of the 0 nu 2 beta-decay parameters could distinguish among all these realizations. The introduction of new physics beyond the standard model, like heavy right-handed neutrinos, scalar triplets, and fermion triplets, let us investigate leptogenesis, and this provides constraints in the realization of the models. && A PREDICTIVE A(4) MODEL, CHARGED LEPTON HIERARCHY AND TRI-BIMAXIMAL SUM RULE || We propose a novel A(4) model in which the Tri-Bimaximal (TB) neutrino mixing and the charged lepton mass hierarchy are reproduced simultaneously. At leading order, the residual symmetry of the neutrino sector is Z(2) X Z(2) Which guarantees the TB Mixing Without adjusting ad hoc free parameters. In the charged lepton sector, one of the previous Z(2) is maximally broken and the resulting mass matrix is nearly diagonal and hierarchical. A natural mechanism for the required vacuum alignment is given with the help of the supersymmetry and an Abelian symmetry factor. In our model, subleading effects which could lead to appreciable deviations from TB mixing are very restrictive giving rise to possible next-to-leading predictions. From in explicit example. we show that Our  && FERMION MASSES AND MIXINGS IN A S-4 BASED MODEL || It has been recently claimed that the symmetry group S-4 yields to the Tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing in a  && FERMION MASSES AND MIXING IN MODELS WITH SO(10) X A(4) SYMMETRY || We study the flavor sector in models where the three families of matter are unified in a (16, 3) representation of the SO(10) X A(4) group. The necessary ingredients to realize tribimaximal mixing in the lepton sector are identified systematically. The nonrenormalizable operators contributing to the fermion mass matrices play an important role. We also present a mechanism to explain the interfamily mass hierarchy of quarks and charged leptons, which relies on a  && COSMOLOGY FAVORING EXTRA RADIATION AND SUB-EV MASS STERILE NEUTRINOS AS AN OPTION || Precision cosmology and big-bang nucleosynthesis mildly favor extra radiation in the Universe beyond photons and ordinary neutrinos, lending support to the existence of low-mass sterile neutrinos. We use the WMAP 7-year data, small-scale cosmic microwave background observations from ACBAR, BICEP, and QuAD, the SDSS 7th data release, and measurement of the Hubble parameter from HST observations to derive credible regions for the assumed common mass scale m(s) and effective number N-s of thermally excited sterile neutrino states. Our results are compatible with the existence of one or perhaps two sterile neutrinos, as suggested by LSND and MiniBooNE, if m(s) is in the sub-eV range. && GLOBAL NEUTRINO DATA AND RECENT REACTOR FLUXES: THE STATUS OF THREE-FLAVOUR OSCILLATION PARAMETERS || We present the results of a global neutrino oscillation data analysis within the three-flavour framework. We include the latest results from the MINOS long-baseline experiment (including electron neutrino appearance and anti-neutrino data), updating all relevant solar (Super-Kamiokande (SK) II + III), atmospheric (SK I + II + III) and reactor (KamLAND) data. Furthermore, we include a recent re-calculation of the anti-neutrino fluxes emitted from nuclear reactors. These results have important consequences for the analysis of reactor experiments and in particular for the status of the mixing angle theta(13). In our recommended default analysis, we find from the global fit that the hint for nonzero theta(13) remains weak, at 1.8 sigma for both neutrino mass hierarchy schemes. However, we discuss in detail the dependence of these results on assumptions regarding the reactor neutrino analysis. && A SIMPLEST A4 MODEL FOR TRI-BIMAXIMAL NEUTRINO MIXING || We present a see-saw A(4) model for Tri-Bimaximal mixing which is based on a very economical flavour symmetry and field content and still possesses all the good features of A(4) models. In particular the charged lepton mass hierarchies are determined by the A(4) x Z(4) flavour symmetry itself without invoking a Froggatt-Nielsen U(1) symmetry. Tri-Bimaximal mixing is exact in leading order while all the mixing angles receive corrections of the same order in next-to-leading approximation. As a consequence the predicted value of theta(13) is within the sensitivity of the experiments which will take data in the near future. The light neutrino spectrum, typical of A(4) see-saw models, with its phenomenological implications, also including leptoproduction, is studied in detail. && LEPTON FLAVOUR VIOLATION IN MODELS WITH A(4) FLAVOUR SYMMETRY || We analyze lepton flavour violating transitions, leptonic magnetic dipole moments (MDMs) and electric dipole moments (EDMs) in a class of models characterized by the flavour symmetry A(4) x Z(3) x U(1)(FN), whose choice is motivated by the approximate tri-bimaximal mixing observed in neutrino oscillations. We construct the relevant low-energy effective Lagrangian where these effects are dominated by dimension six operators. suppressed by the scale M of new physics. All the flavour breaking effects are universally described by the vacuum expectation values <Phi > of a set of spurions. We separately analyze both a supersymmetric and a general case. While the observed discrepancy delta a(mu) in the anomalous MDM of the muon suggests M of order of a few TeV, several data require M above 10 TeV, in particular the limit on EDM of the electron. In the general case also the present limit on BR(mu -> e gamma) requires M > 10 TeV, at least. The branching ratios for mu -> e gamma, tau -> mu gamma and tau -> e gamma are all expected to be of the same order. In the supersymmetric case the constraint from mu -> e gamma is softened and it can be satisfied by a smaller scale M. In this case both the observed delta a(mu) and the current bound on BR(mu -> e gamma) can be satisfied, at the price of a rather small value for |<Phi >|, of the order of a few pet-cents, that reflects on a similar value for theta(13).

Three generations of (5) over bar -plets in SU(5) are assigned to 31 of S-4, while the first and second generations of 10-plets in SU(5) are assigned to 2 of S-4, and the third generation of 10-plets is assigned to 1(1) of S-4. Right-handed neutrinos are also assigned to 2 for the first and second generations and to 1(1) for the third generation. By considering the vacuum alignments of relevant gauge singlet scalars, we predict the quark mixing as well as the tri-bimaximal mixing of neutrino flavors. In particular, the Cabbibo angle is predicted to be 15 degrees in the limit of the vacuum alignment. We can improve the model to predict observed CKM mixing angles as well as the nonvanishing U-e3 of the neutrino flavor mixing. && LOW-ENERGY-THRESHOLD ANALYSIS OF THE PHASE I AND PHASE II DATA SETS OF THE SUDBURY NEUTRINO OBSERVATORY || Results are reported from a joint analysis of Phase I and Phase II data from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. The effective electron kinetic energy threshold used is T-eff = 3.5MeV, the lowest analysis threshold yet achieved with water Cherenkov detector data. In units of 106 cm(-2) s(-1), the total flux of active-flavor neutrinos from B-8 decay in the Sun measured using the neutral current (NC) reaction of neutrinos on deuterons, with no constraint on the B-8 neutrino energy spectrum, is found to be Phi(NC) = 5.140(-0.158)(+0.160)(stat)(-0.117)(+0.132)(syst). These uncertainties are more than a factor of 2 smaller than previously published results. Also presented are the spectra of recoil electrons from the charged current reaction of neutrinos on deuterons and the elastic scattering of electrons. A fit to the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory data in which the free parameters directly describe the total B-8 neutrino flux and the energy-dependent nu(e) survival probability provides a measure of the total B-8 neutrino flux Phi(8B) = 5.046(-0.152)(+0.159)(stat)(-0.123)(+0.107)(syst). Combining these new results with results of all other solar experiments and the KamLAND reactor experiment yields best- fit values of the mixing parameters of theta(12) = 34.06(-0.84)(+1.16) degrees and Delta m(21)(2) = 7.59(-0.21)(+0.20) x 10(-5) eV(2). The global value of Phi(8B) is extracted to a precision of (+2.38)(-2.95)%. In a three-flavor analysis the best fit value of sin(2) theta(13) is 2.00(-1.63)(+2.09) x 10(-2). This implies an upper bound of sin(2) theta(13) < 0.057 (95% C.L.). && REACTOR ANTINEUTRINO ANOMALY || Recently, new reactor antineutrino spectra have been provided for U-235, Pu-239, Pu-241, and U-238, increasing the mean flux by about 3%. To a good approximation, this reevaluation applies to all reactor neutrino experiments. The synthesis of published experiments at reactor-detector distances <100 m leads to a ratio of observed event rate to predicted rate of 0.976 +/- 0.024. With our new flux evaluation, this ratio shifts to 0.943 +/- 0.023, leading to a deviation from unity at 98.6% C. L. which we call the reactor antineutrino anomaly. The compatibility of our results with the existence of a fourth nonstandard neutrino state driving neutrino oscillations at short distances is discussed. The combined analysis of reactor data, gallium solar neutrino calibration experiments, and MiniBooNE-nu data disfavors the no-oscillation hypothesis at 99.8% C. L. The oscillation parameters are such that vertical bar Delta m(new)(2)vertical bar > 1.5 eV(2) (95%) and sin(2) (2 theta(new)) = 0.14 +/- 0.08 (95%). Constraints on the theta(13) neutrino mixing angle are revised. && EVIDENCE OF THETA(13) > 0 FROM GLOBAL NEUTRINO DATA ANALYSIS || The neutrino mixing angle theta(13) is at the focus of current neutrino research. From a global analysis of the available oscillation data in a 3v framework, we previously reported [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 141801 (2008)] hints in favor of theta(13) > 0 at the 90% C. L. Such hints are consistent with the recent indications of a v(mu) -> v(e) appearance in the T2K and MINOS long-baseline accelerator experiments. Our global analysis of all the available data currently provides > 3 sigma evidence for nonzero theta(13), with 1 sigma ranges sin(2)theta(13) = 0.021 +/- 0.007 or 0.025 +/- 0.007, depending on reactor neutrino flux systematics. Updated ranges are also reported for the other 3v oscillation parameters (delta m(2); sin(2)theta(12)) and (Delta m(2); sin(2)theta(23)). && IMPROVED PREDICTIONS OF REACTOR ANTINEUTRINO SPECTRA || Precise predictions of the antineutrino spectra emitted by nuclear reactors is a key ingredient in measurements of reactor neutrino oscillations as well as in recent applications to the surveillance of power plants in the context of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. We report new calculations including the latest information from nuclear databases and a detailed error budget. The first part of this work is the so-called ab initio approach where the total antineutrino spectrum is built from the sum of all beta branches of all fission products predicted by an evolution code. Systematic effects and missing information in nuclear databases lead to final relative uncertainties in the 10-20% range. A prediction of the antineutrino spectrum associated with the fission of U-238 is given based on this ab initio method. For the dominant isotopes we developed a more accurate approach combining information from nuclear databases and reference electron spectra associated with the fission of U-235, Pu-239, and Pu-241, measured at Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in the 1980s. We show how the anchor point of the measured total beta spectra can be used to suppress the uncertainty in nuclear databases while taking advantage of all the information they contain. We provide new reference antineutrino spectra for U-235, Pu-239, and Pu-241 isotopes in the 2-8 MeV range. While the shapes of the spectra and their uncertainties are comparable to those of the previous analysis of the ILL data, the normalization is shifted by about +3% on average. In the perspective of the reanalysis of past experiments and direct use of these results by upcoming oscillation experiments, we discuss the various sources of errors and their correlations as well as the corrections induced by off-equilibrium effects. && CONSTRAINTS ON THETA(13) FROM A THREE-FLAVOR OSCILLATION ANALYSIS OF REACTOR ANTINEUTRINOS AT KAMLAND || We present new constraints on the neutrino oscillation parameters Delta m(21)(2), theta(12), and theta(13) from a three-flavor analysis of solar and KamLAND data. The KamLAND data set includes data acquired following a radiopurity upgrade and amounts to a total exposure of 3.49 x 10(32) target-proton-year. Under the assumption of CPT invariance, a two-flavor analysis (theta(13) = 0) of the KamLAND and solar data yields the best-fit values tan(2)theta(12) = 0.444(-0.030)(+0.036) and Delta m(21)(2) = 7.50(-0.20)(+0.19) x 10(-5) eV(2); a three-flavor analysis with theta(13) as a free parameter yields the best-fit values tan(2)theta(12) = 0.452(-0.033)(+0.035), Delta m(21)(2) = 7.50(-0.20)(+0.19) x 10(-5) eV(2), and sin(2)theta(13) = 0.020(-0.016)(+0.016). This theta(13) interval is consistent with other recent work combining the CHOOZ, atmospheric and long-baseline accelerator experiments. We also present a new global theta(13) analysis, incorporating the CHOOZ, atmospheric, and accelerator data, which indicates sin(2)theta(13) = 0.009(-0.007)(+0.013). A nonzero value is suggested, but only at the 79% C.L. && MEASUREMENT OF THE NEUTRINO MASS SPLITTING AND FLAVOR MIXING BY MINOS || Measurements of neutrino oscillations using the disappearance of muon neutrinos from the Fermilab NuMI neutrino beam as observed by the two MINOS detectors are reported. New analysis methods have been applied to an enlarged data sample from an exposure of 7.25 x 10(20) protons on target. A fit to neutrino oscillations yields values of vertical bar Delta m(2)vertical bar = (2.32(-0.08)(+0.12) x 10(-3) eV(2) for the atmospheric mass splitting and sin(2)(2 theta) > 0.90 (90% C.L.) for the mixing angle. Pure neutrino decay and quantum decoherence hypotheses are excluded at 7 and 9 standard deviations, respectively. && ATMOSPHERIC NEUTRINO OSCILLATION ANALYSIS WITH SUBLEADING EFFECTS IN SUPER-KAMIOKANDE I, II, AND III || We present a search for nonzero theta(13) and deviations of sin(2)theta(23) from 0.5 in the oscillations of atmospheric neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande I, II, and III. No distortions of the neutrino flux consistent with nonzero theta(13) are found and both neutrino mass hierarchy hypotheses are in agreement with the data. The data are best fit at Delta m(2) = 2.1 x 10(-3) eV(2), sin(2)theta(13) = 0.0, and sin(2)theta(23) = 0.5. In the normal (inverted) hierarchy theta(13) and Delta m(2) are constrained at the one-dimensional 90% C.L. to sin(2)theta(13) < 0.04(0.09) and 1.9(1.7) x 10(-3) < Delta m(2) < 2.6(2.7) x 10(-3) eV(2). The atmospheric mixing angle is within 0.407 <= sin(2)theta(23) <= 0.583 at 90% C.L. && ARE THERE STERILE NEUTRINOS AT THE EV SCALE? || New predictions for the antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors suggest that reactor experiments may have measured a deficit in this flux, which can be interpreted in terms of oscillations between the known active neutrinos and new sterile states. We perform a reanalysis of global short-baseline neutrino oscillation data in a framework with one or two sterile neutrinos. While one sterile neutrino is still not sufficient to reconcile the signals suggested by reactor experiments and by the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments with null results from other searches, we find that, with the new reactor flux prediction, the global fit improves considerably when two sterile neutrinos are introduced. && IMPROVED SEARCH FOR MUON-NEUTRINO TO ELECTRON-NEUTRINO OSCILLATIONS IN MINOS || We report the results of a search for nu(e) appearance in a nu(mu) beam in the MINOS long-baseline neutrino experiment. With an improved analysis and an increased exposure of 8.2 x 10(20) protons on the NuMI target at Fermilab, we find that 2sin(2)(theta(23))sin(2)(2 theta(13)) < 0.12(0.20) at 90% confidence level for delta = 0 and the normal ( inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy, with a best-fit of 2sin(2)(theta(23))sin(2)(2 theta(13)) = 0.041(-0.031)(+0.047)(0.079(-0.053)(+0.071)). The theta(13) 0 hypothesis is disfavored by the MINOS data at the 89% confidence level. && NONZERO THETA(13) FOR NEUTRINO MIXING IN THE CONTEXT OF A(4) SYMMETRY || In the original 2004 paper which first derived tribimaximal mixing in the context of A(4), i.e., the non-Abelian finite symmetry group of the tetrahedron, as its simplest application, it was also pointed out how theta(13) not equal 0 may be accommodated. On the strength of the new T2K result that 0.03(0.04) <= sin(2)2 theta(13) <= 0.28(0.34) for delta(CP) = 0 and normal (inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy, we perform a more detailed analysis of how this original idea may be realized in the context of A(4). && CONSTRAINTS ON MASSIVE STERILE NEUTRINO SPECIES FROM CURRENT AND FUTURE COSMOLOGICAL DATA || Sterile massive neutrinos are a natural extension of the standard model of elementary particles. The energy density of the extra sterile massive states affects cosmological measurements in an analogous way to that of active neutrino species. We perform here an analysis of current cosmological data and derive bounds on the masses of the active and the sterile neutrino states, as well as on the number of sterile states. The so-called (3 + 2) models, with three sub-eV active massive neutrinos plus two sub-eV massive sterile species, is well within the 95% CL allowed regions when considering cosmological data only. If the two extra sterile states have thermal abundances at decoupling, big bang nucleosynthesis bounds compromise the viability of (3 + 2) models. Forecasts from future cosmological data on the active and sterile neutrino parameters are also presented. Independent measurements of the neutrino mass from tritium beta-decay experiments and of the Hubble constant could shed light on sub-eV massive sterile neutrino scenarios. && DISCRETE FLAVOUR SYMMETRIES IN LIGHT OF T2K || We show that a non-vanishing angle theta(13) of order 0.1 can be predicted in the framework of discrete flavour symmetries. We assume that left-handed leptons transform as triplets under a group G(f) which is broken in such a way that neutrino and charged lepton sectors remain invariant under the subgroups G(v) and G(e) of G(f), respectively. In this limit mixing angles and the Dirac CP violating phase delta(CP) are determined. By choosing G(f) = Delta(6n(2)) (n = 4.8). G(v) = Z(2) x Z(2) and G(e) = Z(3) we find sin(2)theta(13) = 0.045(0.011) for n = 4(8). At the same time theta(23) and theta(12) remain close to their experimental best fit values, particularly in the case n = 8, where sin(2)theta(23) approximate to 0.424 and sin(2)theta(12) approximate to 0.337. delta(CP) is predicted to be 0 or pi so that CP is conserved in our examples.

With improved detector calibrations, a full detector simulation, and improved analysis methods, the systematic uncertainty on the total neutrino flux is estimated to be +/- 2.1%, which is about two thirds of the systematic uncertainty for the first phase of Super-Kamiokande. The observed B-8 solar flux in the 5.0 to 20 MeV total electron energy region is 2.32 +/- 0.04(stat) +/- 0.05(sys) x 10(6) cm(-2) sec(-1) under the assumption of pure electron-flavor content, in agreement with previous measurements. A combined oscillation analysis is carried out using SK-I, II, and III data, and the results are also combined with the results of other solar neutrino experiments. The best-fit oscillation parameters are obtained to be sin(2)theta(12) = 0.30(-0.01)(+/- 0.02)(tan(2)theta(12) = 0.42(-0.02)(+0.04)) and Delta m(21)(2) = 6.2(-1.9)(+1.1) x 10(-5) eV(2). Combined with KamLAND results, the best-fit oscillation parameters are found to be sin(2)theta(12) = 0.31 +/- 0.01(tan(2)theta(12 =) 0.44 +/- 0: 03) and Delta m(21)(2) = 7.6 +/- 0.2 x 10(-5) eV(2). The B-8 neutrino flux obtained from global solar neutrino experiments is 5.3 +/- 0.2(stat + sys) x 10(6) cm(-2) s(-1), while the B-8 flux becomes 5.1 +/- 0.1(stat + sys) x 10(6) cm(-2) s(-1) by adding KamLAND results. In a three-flavor analysis combining all solar neutrino experiments, the upper limit of sin(2)theta(13) is 0.060 at 95% C.L.. After combination with KamLAND results, the upper limit of sin(2)theta(13) is found to be 0.059 at 95% C.L. && A ROBUST UPPER LIMIT ON N-EFF FROM BBN, CIRCA 2011 || We derive here a robust bound on the effective number of neutrinos from constraints on primordial nucleosynthesis yields of deuterium and helium. In particular, our results are based on very weak assumptions on the astrophysical determination of the helium abundance, namely that the minimum effect of stellar processing is to keep constant (rather than increase, as expected) the helium content of a low-metallicity gas. Using the results of a recent analysis of extragalactic HII regions as upper limit, we find that Delta N-eff <= 1 at 95% C.L., quite independently of measurements on the baryon density from cosmic microwave background anisotropy data and of the neutron lifetime input. In our approach, we also find that primordial nucleosynthesis alone has no significant preference for an effective number of neutrinos larger than the standard value. The similar to 2 sigma hint sometimes reported in the literature is thus driven by CMB data alone and/or is the result of a questionable regression protocol to infer a measurement of primordial helium abundance.

All rights reserved. && DETERMINATION OF ANTINEUTRINO SPECTRA FROM NUCLEAR REACTORS || In this paper we study the effect of well-known higher-order corrections to the allowed beta-decay spectrum on the determination of antineutrino spectra resulting from the decays of fission fragments. In particular, we try to estimate the associated theory errors and find that induced currents like weak magnetism may ultimately limit our ability to improve the current accuracy and under certain circumstance could even greatly increase the theoretical errors. We also perform a critical evaluation of the errors associated with our method to extract the antineutrino spectrum using synthetic beta spectra. It turns out that a fit using only virtual beta branches with a judicious choice of the effective nuclear charge provides results with a minimal bias. We apply this method to actual data for U-235, Pu-239, and Pu-241 and confirm, within errors, recent results, which indicate a net 3% upward shift in energy-averaged antineutrino fluxes. However, we also find significant shape differences which can, in principle, be tested by high-statistics antineutrino data samples. && PREDICTIONS VIA LARGE THETA(13) FROM CASCADES || We investigate a relation among neutrino observables, three mixing angles and two mass squared differences, from a cascade texture of neutrino mass matrix. We show an allowed region of the correlation by use of current data of neutrino oscillation experiments. The relation predicts sharp correlations among neutrino mixing angles as 0.315 less than or similar to sin(2)theta(12) less than or similar to 0.332 and 0.480 less than or similar to sin(2)theta(23) less than or similar to 0.500 with a large theta(13) (0.03 < sin(2)2 theta(13) < 0.28). These magnitudes are modified 0.310 less than or similar to sin(2)theta(12) less than or similar to 0.330 and 0.540 less than or similar to sin(2)theta(23) less than or similar to 0.560 when the charged lepton mass matrix also has the cascade form.

All rights reserved. && GETTING AT LARGE THETA(13) WITH ALMOST MAXIMAL THETA(23) FROM TRI-BIMAXIMAL MIXING || We introduce a small correction term, delta M-v, in the neutrino sector and examine whether a large theta(13) and an almost maximal theta(23) can simultaneously be obtained starting from the tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing. It is found that one can easily gain theta(13) similar or equal to 10 degrees, which is favored by the recent T2K experiment, by taking account of the enhancement due to the degeneracy among three neutrino masses. We also find that (delta M-v)(22) = (delta M-v)(33) is a key condition for theta(23) similar or equal to 45 degrees. && COMMON ORIGIN OF PI-TAU AND CP BREAKING IN THE NEUTRINO SEESAW, BARYON ASYMMETRY, AND HIDDEN FLAVOR SYMMETRY || We conjecture that all CP violations (both Dirac and Majorana types) arise from a common origin in the neutrino seesaw. With this conceptually attractive and simple conjecture, we deduce that mu-tau breaking shares the common origin with all CP violations. We study the common origin of mu-tau and CP breaking in the Dirac mass matrix of seesaw Lagrangian (with right-handed neutrinos being mu-tau blind), which uniquely leads to inverted mass ordering of light neutrinos. We then predict a very different correlation between the two small mu-tau breaking observables theta(13) - 0 degrees and theta(23) - 45 degrees, which can saturate the present experimental upper limit on theta(13). This will be tested against our previous normal mass-ordering scheme by the ongoing oscillation experiments. We also analyze the correlations of theta(13) with Jarlskog invariant and neutrinoless beta beta-decay observable. From the common origin of CP and mu-tau breaking in the neutrino seesaw, we establish a direct link between the low energy CP violations and the cosmological CP violation for baryon asymmetry. With these we further predict a lower bound on theta(13), supporting the ongoing probes of theta(13) at Daya Bay, Double Chooz, and RENO experiments. Finally, we analyze the general model-independent Z(2) circle times Z(2) symmetry structure of the light neutrino sector, and map it into the seesaw sector, where one of the Z(2)'s corresponds to the mu-tau symmetry Z(2)(mu tau) and another the hidden symmetry Z(2)(s) (revealed in our previous work) which dictates the solar mixing angle theta(12). We derive the physical consequences of this Z(2)(s) and its possible partial violation in the presence of mu-tau breaking (with or without the neutrino seesaw), regarding the theta(12) determination and the correlation between mu-tau breaking observables. && BREAKING TRI-BIMAXIMAL MIXING AND LARGE THETA(13) || The long baseline neutrino experiment, T2K, and the reactor experiment, Double Chooz will soon present new data. If we expect sin theta(13) to be 0.1 - 0.2, which is close to the present experimental upper bound, we should not persist in the paradigm of the tri-bimaximal mixing. We discuss breaking the tri-bimaximal mixing by adding a simple mass matrix, which could be derived from some non-Abelian discrete symmetries. It is found that sin theta(13) = 0.1 - 0.2 is expected in our model independent analysis of the generalized mass matrix for the normal or inverted hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum. On the other hand, sin(2) theta(23) and sin(2) theta(12) are expected to be not far from 1/2 and 1/3, respectively. As a typical example, we also discuss the A(4) flavor model with the 1 and 1' flavons, which break the tri-bimaximal mixing considerably. In this modified version of the Altarelli and Feruglio model, sin theta(13) is predicted to be around 0.15 in the case of the normal hierarchical neutrino masses m(3) >> n2, m(1), and 0.2 in the case of the inverted hierarchy m(3) << m(2), m(1). The form of the neutrino mass matrix looks rather interesting it is suggestive of other discrete symmetries as well. && 3+1 AND 3+2 STERILE NEUTRINO FITS || We present the results of fits of short-baseline neutrino-oscillation data in 3 + 1 and 3 + 2 neutrino-mixing schemes. In spite of the presence of a tension in the interpretation of the data, 3 + 1 neutrino mixing is attractive for its simplicity and for the natural correspondence of one new entity (a sterile neutrino) with a new effect (short-baseline oscillations). The allowed regions in the oscillation parameter space can be tested in near-future experiments. In the framework of 3 + 2 neutrino mixing, there is less tension in the interpretation of the data, at the price of introducing a second sterile neutrino. Moreover, the improvement of the parameter goodness of fit is mainly a statistical effect due to an increase in the number of parameters. The CP violation in short-baseline experiments allowed in 3 + 2 neutrino mixing can explain the positive <(nu)(mu)over bar> -> (nu) over bar (e) signal and the negative <(nu)(mu)over bar> -> (nu) over bar (e) measurement in the MiniBooNE experiment. For the CP-violating phase, we obtained two minima of the marginal chi(2) close to the two values where CP violation is maximal. && FIRST DIRECT OBSERVATION OF MUON ANTINEUTRINO DISAPPEARANCE || This Letter reports the first direct observation of muon antineutrino disappearance. The MINOS experiment has taken data with an accelerator beam optimized for (nu) over bar (mu) production, accumulating an exposure of 1.71 x 10(20) protons on target. In the Far Detector, 97 charged current (nu) over bar (mu) events are observed. The no-oscillation hypothesis predicts 156 events and is excluded at 6.3 sigma. The best fit to oscillation yields vertical bar Delta(m) over bar (2)vertical bar = [3.36(-0.40)(+0.46)(stat) +/- 0.06(sys)] x 10(-3) eV(2), sin(2)(2 (theta) over bar) = 0.86(-0.12)(+0.11)(stat) +/- 0.01(syst). The MINOS nu(mu) and (nu) over bar (mu) measurements are consistent at the 2.0% confidence level, assuming identical underlying oscillation parameters. && SYSTEMATIC SEARCH FOR SUCCESSFUL LEPTON MIXING PATTERNS WITH NONZERO THETA(13) ||   && BIMAXIMAL MIXING AND LARGE THETA(13) IN A SUSY SU(5) MODEL BASED ON S-4 ||   && SIZEABLE THETA(13) FROM THE CHARGED LEPTON SECTOR IN SU(5), (TRI-)BIMAXIMAL NEUTRINO MIXING AND DIRAC CP VIOLATION ||   && TRIMAXIMAL MIXING WITH PREDICTED THETA(13) FROM A NEW TYPE OF CONSTRAINED SEQUENTIAL DOMINANCE ||   && RESOLVING THE REACTOR NEUTRINO ANOMALY WITH THE KATRIN NEUTRINO EXPERIMENT ||   && IMPLICATIONS OF 3+1 SHORT-BASELINE NEUTRINO OSCILLATIONS ||   && NEAR MAXIMAL ATMOSPHERIC MIXING IN NEUTRINO MASS MATRICES WITH TWO VANISHING MINORS ||   && THE PRIMORDIAL ABUNDANCE OF HE-4: EVIDENCE FOR NON-STANDARD BIG BANG NUCLEOSYNTHESIS || We present a new determination of the primordial helium mass fraction Y-p, based on 93 spectra of 86 low-metallicity extragalactic H (II) regions, and taking into account the latest developments concerning systematic effects. These include collisional and fluorescent enhancements of He I recombination lines, underlying He I stellar absorption lines, collisional and fluorescent excitation of hydrogen lines, and temperature and ionization structure of the H II region. Using Monte Carlo methods to solve simultaneously for the above systematic effects, we find the best value to be Y-p = 0.2565 +/- 0.0010 (stat.) +/- 0.0050 (syst.). This value is higher at the 2 sigma level than the value given by standard big bang nucleosynthesis implying deviations from it. The effective number of light neutrino species N-nu is equal to 3.68(-0.70)(+0.80) (2 sigma) and 3.80(-0.70)(+0.80) (2 sigma) for a neutron lifetime tau(n) equal to 885.4 +/- 0.9 s and 878.5 +/- 0.8 s, respectively, i.e., it is larger than the experimental value of 2.993 +/- 0.011. && THE ATACAMA COSMOLOGY TELESCOPE: COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETERS FROM THE 2008 POWER SPECTRUM || We present cosmological parameters derived from the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation observed at 148 GHz and 218 GHz over 296 deg(2) with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) during its 2008 season. ACT measures fluctuations at scales 500 < l < 10,000. We fit a model for the lensed CMB, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ), and foreground contribution to the 148 GHz and 218 GHz power spectra, including thermal and kinetic SZ, Poisson power from radio and infrared point sources, and clustered power from infrared point sources. At l = 3000, about half the power at 148 GHz comes from primary CMB after masking bright radio sources. The power from thermal and kinetic SZ is estimated to be B-3000 = 6.8 +/- 2.9 mu K-2, where B-l = l (l + 1) C-l/2 pi. The IR Poisson power at 148 GHz is B-3000 = 7.8 +/- 0.7 mu K-2 (Cl = 5.5 +/- 0.5 nK(2)), and a clustered IR component is required with B-3000 = 4.6 +/- 0.9 mu K-2, assuming an analytic model for its power spectrum shape. At 218 GHz only about 15% of the power, approximately 27 mu K-2, is CMB anisotropy at l = 3000. The remaining 85% is attributed to IR sources (approximately 50% Poisson and 35% clustered), with spectral index alpha = 3.69 +/- 0.14 for flux scaling as S(v) proportional to v(alpha). We estimate primary cosmological parameters from the less contaminated 148 GHz spectrum, marginalizing over SZ and source power. The Lambda CDM cosmological model is a good fit to the data (chi(2)/dof = 29/46), and Lambda CDM parameters estimated from ACT+Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) are consistent with the seven-year WMAP limits, with scale invariant ns = 1 excluded at 99.7% confidence level (CL) (3 sigma). A model with no CMB lensing is disfavored at 2.8 sigma. By measuring the third to seventh acoustic peaks, and probing the Silk damping regime, the ACT data improve limits on cosmological parameters that affect the small-scale CMB power. The ACT data combined with WMAP give a 6 sigma detection of primordial helium, with Y-P = 0.313 +/- 0.044, and a 4 sigma detection of relativistic species, assumed to be neutrinos, with N-eff = 5.3 +/- 1.3 (4.6 +/- 0.8 with BAO+H-0 data). From the CMB alone the running of the spectral index is constrained to be dn(s)/d ln k = - 0.034 +/- 0.018, the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is r < 0.25 (95% CL), and the possible contribution of Nambu cosmic strings to the power spectrum is constrained to string tension G mu < 1.6 x 10(-7) ( 95% CL). && THE ATACAMA COSMOLOGY TELESCOPE: A MEASUREMENT OF THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND POWER SPECTRUM AT 148 AND 218 GHZ FROM THE 2008 SOUTHERN SURVEY || We present measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum made by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope at 148 GHz and 218 GHz, as well as the cross-frequency spectrum between the two channels. Our results clearly show the second through the seventh acoustic peaks in the CMB power spectrum. The measurements of these higher-order peaks provide an additional test of the Lambda CDM cosmological model. At l > 3000, we detect power in excess of the primary anisotropy spectrum of the CMB. At lower multipoles 500 < l < 3000, we find evidence for gravitational lensing of the CMB in the power spectrum at the 2.8 sigma level. We also detect a low level of Galactic dust in our maps, which demonstrates that we can recover known faint, diffuse signals. && A MEASUREMENT OF THE DAMPING TAIL OF THE COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND POWER SPECTRUM WITH THE SOUTH POLE TELESCOPE ||   && STERILE NEUTRINOS WITH EV MASSES IN COSMOLOGY - HOW DISFAVOURED EXACTLY? ||  "
