This is one of the most important predictions of quantum electrodynamic theory, but has not been observed yet. The effect that will be measured is the ellipticity acquired by a linearly polarized laser beam when passing through a high magnetic field region in vacuum. A high-finesse optical cavity will be used to enhance the optical path of the beam in the magnetic field region. With the present technology an increase of the optical path up to one million times is achievable. The key part of the experimental apparatus is a specially designed 1.5 meter long 10 Tesla pulsed magnet. The ellipticity produced by such an high magnetic field will be measured using the state-of-the-art in high-sensitive ellipsometry.The project will result in an advance in high intense magnetic field technology as well as in the applied optical field of high sensitive ellipsometry. From a scientific point of view, besides the great challenge to measure for the first time the magnetic vacuum birefringence, the implications on cosmology and astroparticle physics are also very important: the experiment test both the energy of the quantum vacuum, whose value influences the universe dynamics, and the existence of new particles which are dark matter candidates.|0

These date are being examined to determine the mass and width of the W boson, to search for anomalous W interactions, and to search for new particles such as the Higgs boson and supersymmetric particles. The group intends to concentrate its effort on Higgs searches. Funding for continued L3 effort is requested in a separate proposal (see K. Riles, PHY-99 84997). This group expects its L3 effort to almost completely end by fall 2000.<br/><br/>The Mini-BooNe experiment using the Fermilab booster beam is intended to make a definitive test of the tentative neutrino oscillation result, nm ne, observed by the LSND experiment at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The putative LSND signal corresponds to a neutrino mass difference of a few tenths of an eV. This is a range of interest if neutrinos serve as the cosmological ""hot"" dark matter. This experiment is scheduled to begin taking data in 2001, and thus provides a good match to the expected end of the group's L3 activity."|0

It will be hosted by the University of Hue and is supported by BCVSPIN (Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India, Nepal) a group that supports this area of science. The U.S. organizer is Professor Qaisar Shafi at the University of Delaware in Newark. Other sponsors are the University of Virginia in Blacksburg; Hue University College of Education in Vietnam; the Institute of Physics in Hanoi, Vietnam and the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy. In addition to participation from the countries mentioned above, it will also include scientists and graduate students from Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos and Thailand. The scientific motivation for this Institute is based on the premise that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) now operating at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland will be able to unlock some of the deepest secrets of the universe. There are many experimentalists and theoretical physicists racing to discover new laws of physics. Such discoveries could greatly alter the face of physics. The main research areas to be discussed include: 1) the origin of mass; 2) the origin of matter in the universe; 3) the nature of dark matter particles; and 4) supersymmetric nature. In addition, they will discuss if there may be complimentary ground-breaking satellite and terrestrial experiments that are helping lay the foundations of modern (post big-bang) cosmology. Each of the above topics will be discussed in depth by leading experts from the U.S. and Europe. The principle lectures will be held during the morning and afternoon, and the evenings will be reserved for discussion and support sessions. <br/><br/>It is anticipated that this Institute will facilitate the creation of global scientific networks among physicists from the U.S. and Asian institutions. It also provides an exceptional opportunity for interaction between U.S. scientists and students with their counterparts. U.S. researchers could select Asian graduate students and postdocs to work at their home institutions and invite faculty members for short research stays in order to engage in new collaborative projects. It will also provide the young Asian scientists and students, who often lack access to conferences, journals and scientific exchange, the opportunity to interact with world class experimentalists and theorists in particle physics and cosmology thereby allowing them to keep abreast of the most recent developments and perhaps even provide them a venue for presenting their ideas and work as well.|0

The AMANDA uses natural 1.5-mile deep Antarctic ice as a Cerenkov detector. The telescope's effective area has reached 40,000 sq. m for the detection of point sources of cosmic neutrinos and exceeds 50,000 sq. m for gamma ray bursts at all zenith angles. The AMANDA detector has now operated for more than three years in its final configuration of 677 optical modules on deployed 19 strings. The detector collects approximately 4 terabytes of data yearly. These data are filtered at a high level at the South Pole and transmitted back to UW-Madison at a rate of about 3 gigabytes per day via the geostationary satellite systems and stored for further analysis and distribution to the AMANDA collaboration. Also stored are simulation data needed to analyze the experimental data. Presently 6 TB of AMANDA data is held online on large high availability RAID arrays. To enhance the quality of data management UW-AMANDA is taking the lead in adapting the DIF metadata standard to astrophysics. The scientific analyses in AMANDA can be classified as follows: (a) Atmospheric muon flux: the cosmic ray muon flux has been used to do a precision calibration of the detector with high statistics; (b) Atmospheric neutrinos: AMANDA's performance has been calibrated by reconstructing upward-going muons produced by atmospheric muon neutrinos. The detector, in steady operation, collects roughly four neutrinos per day using fast on-line analysis software. The atmospheric neutrino spectrum is now measured up to 100 TeV; (c) Cascades produced by the secondary electromagnetic and hadronic showers initiated by electron and tau neutrinos. The flux level is approaching where the much lower atmospheric neutrino fluxes should be observed, as well as the prompt flux from the decay of heavy quarks can be measured; (d) Search for point sources of cosmic neutrinos such as supernova remnants, mini-quasars, active galaxies; (e) Search for a diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos; (f) Search for gamma ray bursts; and (g) Extremely high energy events from cosmological remnants or mini-black holes, magnetic monopoles, cold dark matter particles. The UW plays a major role in all analyses except for the last one. With the University of Delaware, the UW group determined that the fraction of heavy elements in the cosmic ray flux increases with energy in the region of the knee, by studying the muon response of AMANDA to air showers detected by the SPASE array deployed at the surface. The UW AMANDA group has pioneered many of the programs that are now part of the extensive IceCube education and outreach program including the Science in the Ice course that involves high school teachers and their students, as well as participants in the TEA (Teacher Experience in Antarctica) program.|0

Designed to detect and reconstruct ultrahigh energy neutrinos at energy scales that extend well beyond those attainable with modern accelerators, these neutrino telescopes will enable particle astrophysicists to peer into the hearts of some of the densest, most energetic phenomena in the universe, such as gamma ray bursts and active galactic nuclei, believed to be powered by supermassive black holes. The instruments are also sensitive to possible nearby dark matter annihilations, the detection of which would have a profound impact on our understanding of the composition and life-cycle of the universe. Consisting of widely-spaced three-dimensional arrays of photomultiplier tubes deeply buried in the exceptionally clear ice at the South Pole, the instruments are sensitive to a wide variety of other energetic and rare phenomena as well.<br/><br/>We aim to exploit the considerable discovery potential of IceCube, and in particular to analyze the rich dataset that will be provided by the combined IceCube and AMANDA detectors during the next few years of full-fledged IceCube data-taking. During this time, we will have a detector that is more than an order of magnitude larger than any other existing comparable detector. At Penn State, we will use this world-class device to measure the flux of atmospheric electron neutrinos at high energies and search for deviations from the expected spectrum as evidence of new physics, to search for ultrahigh energy neutrinos from transient sources, and to develop techniques to detect tau neutrinos, which are excellent indicators of extragalactic origin. We will also explore the use of specialized high-performance, high-memory computational facilities available at Penn State, which may offer significant benefits for physics analysis. Finally, in collaboration with several colleagues at Penn State, we will be developing and offering a series of professional development workshops for high school teachers, to illustrate the connections between our particle astrophysics research and core science concepts taught as part of national and state science standards, and to give teachers ideas for bringing this research into the classroom.|0

Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector. <br/><br/>This proposal requests continued base-program support to work on the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment which, in conjunction with the initial funding of the SuperCDMS project grant, will allow for (a) the completion of the CDMS-II experiment, which is fully constructed and acquiring science data at the Soudan Mine, (b) the testing and underground operation in the CDMS-II infrastructure at Soudan of two new ?SuperTowers,? each comprised of six next-generation detectors, and (c) a modest effort of long-range R&D to develop and test new hardware and detectors for possible followup experiments. <br/><br/>This program will have broader impact than the WIMP search results. The technical development will push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors, which have increasing applications in astrophysics, from optical astronomy to x-rays and cosmic microwave backgrounds studies, as well as other branches of physics such as quantum computing. In addition, the SuperCDMS collaboration will continue its support of public outreach program at Soudan, which hosts thousands of visitors each year for tours of the mine and laboratory.|0

When high energy cosmic rays interact with matter, magnetic fields and ambient photons they generate high energy gamma rays and/or neutrinos of high energy. Some of these neutral particles travel directly to the earth and, when observed by gamma ray telescopes, can both provide essential information about not only the origin and distribution of cosmic rays and their sources, but also can serve as probes for gamma rays expected from the annihilation of dark matter. Thus they allow the study fundamental high energy astrophysics as well as particle physics. As the flux of these high energy gamma rays is small, large acceptance detectors with good pointing and adequate cosmic ray rejection capabilities are essential for this study. <br/><br/>The Milagro detector uses a new technique to detect high energy gamma rays. It allows the simultaneous and continuous viewing of the entire overhead sky in the TeV energy domain. It detects the bundles of energetic particles produced by high energy gamma ray interacting in the atmosphere, which acts like an amplifier of each high energy photon. Detection occurs by sampling light photons produced by these relativistic particles in a 6 million gallon water tank instrumented with 737 photomultiplier tubes. The pulse height and arrival times of these photons permit reconstruction of the celestial direction of the original particle, as well as rejection of most of the unwanted cosmic ray showers. Its continuous operation allows observation of both steady and transient sources of TeV gamma rays. <br/><br/>Milagro has detected and measured the energy spectrum of gamma rays from the Crab neubla; from active galactic nuclei (AGNS) blazars Mrk 501 and 421 in their active phases; from a gamma ray burster (GRB); and of diffuse TeV gamma ray emission from the inner galactic disc region from interaction of cosmic rays with matter in the galactic disc, and from TeV gamma ray sources in the Cygnus arm of the galaxy. These observations provide new and important data for the understanding of the origin, acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays. Under this NSF grant, work will continue on refining the observations of these and other possible objects, and on analyzing the data.<br/><br/>The Milagro experiment and data have provided excellent training ground for undergraduate student research experience and for graduate student training in hardware and software. UCI also has several active programs, such as COSMOS and Quarknet , for outreach to K-12 teachers and students. We have been involved in communicating to school students at K-12 levels and to seniors (Academy of Continued Life Long learning).|0

The focus in this project will be on two promising ways forward. One will be to use observations of gamma-rays towards the luminous satellites of the Milky Way in order to constrain or detect weak-scale thermal dark matter. Weak-scale thermal dark matter is the most widely studied dark-matter candidate and is motivated by particle-physics models at the high (electroweak-scale) energies currently being probed at the Large Hadron Collider. The other way forward will be to develop simplified models to describe dark-matter halo density profiles in the presence of significant self-interactions and compare to observations. As part of the project, the PI will provide a map between these preferred models and the underlying particle-physics models in which such phenomenology is realized. <br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The PI will develop a cosmology and particle-physics cluster for the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (i.e., the ""COSMOS Program"" at UC Irvine). COSMOS is a program for motivated high-school students and currently has a cluster in astronomy at UC Irvine but none in particle physics. Based on input from faculty teaching the astronomy cluster, it is envisioned that a particle physics and cosmology module will be highly subscribed."|0

The confluence of increasingly sensitive direct detection experiments, large indirect detection experiments, the discovery of more local group galaxies and the Large Hadron Collider is likely to dramatically broaden our understanding of dark matter in the next few years. The PI proposes to undertake novel investigations that deal with the collisionless and collisional aspects of dark matter including indirect detection of dark matter and coupling of dark matter and dark energy. The PI will also investigate how strong gravitational lensing data sets made available by future large sky surveys may be used to study dark energy. The PI will also investigate constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) on a large class of beyond standard model theories that have charged particles that decay during or after BBN. The education and outreach plan of this program is focused on the UC Irvine Physics Road Show program. The Road Show takes basic physics demonstrations, presented by UCI undergraduates, to an ethnically and economically diverse group of elementary and middle school students in schools in the neighboring districts.|0

As a theory, it incorporates all known particles and forces of nature, excluding gravity. It has been extremely successful in describing known phenomena, but we are prompted to ask whether there is physics beyond the Standard Model. Are there new forces of nature, or new states of matter, which are important to the universe? In this project, the PI intends to explore new theories of physics beyond the Standard Model, focusing on interesting phenomenological signals absent in most conventional models. He will study many topics including unexpected signals of the dark sector in terrestrial and cosmological experiments, models which allow wider ranges of flavor violation, connections between neutrino masses and dark matter, and models of dark matter motivated by cosmic ray signals. By exploring what connections could exist between these apparently disparate fields --- dark matter, cosmic rays, neutrino physics, and collider physics --- the PI hopes to gain insights into the possible nature of these diverse unexplored phenomena, and find ways in which terrestrial and cosmological studies can complement one another.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have two key broader impacts. First, the PI will maintain a continued effort to participate in summer schools and will compile a regularly updated set of lecture notes on dark matter. This will provide an important resource for graduate students or interested faculty in a rapidly evolving field. Second, the PI will continue his very successful outreach effort with the Governor's School West in Salem, North Carolina. This public summer school draws students from across the state, from varied socioeconomic backgrounds, providing an opportunity to promote physics research and careers to interested and talented students, and counsel them on pursuing such a path. This program has been highly successful over the last several years, and offers year- on-year interactions with new groups of students through an established educational setup.|0

Most of the matter of the universe (the ""dark matter"", solidly established by astronomical and cosmological observations) consists of something undiscovered, and thus there must exist new particles not in the Standard Model. Additionally, the presence of the Higgs boson and the expected properties of a quantum field theory together suggest that new particles and fields will be discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, because the properties of both of these new sets of particles are unknown, a broad theoretical study is required in order to evaluate what possible new particles might be discoverable with present techniques and what new search strategies might be needed. As part of this project, Professor Weiner intends to investigate a broad range of theoretical scenarios, both top-down (motivated by new and existing theoretical scenarios) and bottom-up (motivated by new signatures) as well as their experimental implications for the LHC and for direct-detection experiments. Additionally, Professor Weiner will pursue studies to understand the sensitivities of dark-matter searches, with a focus on the sensitivities of the astrophysical assumptions present in the existing analyses.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project will be wide ranging. Professor Weiner will involve both students and postdocs in his research program, providing opportunities to train future scientists. He will also continue his participation in physics summer schools (as invited), such as the TASI, CLASHEP, ICTP and Les Houches programs, to educate current PhD students on active research topics. Finally, he will continue his efforts to engage the public through public lectures as well as his outreach at the high-school level, anchored by his continued participation with the Governor's School summer program in North Carolina."|0

Recent work has extended the measurement of mass distributions from the strong lensing regime of multiple quasar images and giant arcs to the weaker lensing effects seen in the periphery of massive clusters of galaxies. With the unique wide field imaging system of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), it will be possible to extend such lensing studies to very wide fields, and study density variations in the universe independent of the bias between luminous and dark matter. The weak lensing technique is the only way to directly probe large scale structures in the mass density of the universe, and the SDSS offers the only opportunity to do this over a large fraction of the sky. These methods will be used to measure the surface density of matter over one fourth of the sky, to probe the evolution of this density field using photometric and spectroscopic redshifts, to measure directly the bias between the observed local distribution of luminous matter and the underlying mass distribution, and to measure the lensing mass of nearby clusters like the Coma cluster. This is a difficult program, requiring careful control of systematic errors, but the SDSS is exceedingly well designed to meet these challenges. A complementary program would search for quasar lenses within the SDSS data for use in related studies. Data generated by the SDSS will be used both for traditional graduate and undergraduate research, and also as a tool for bringing current research into the introductory classroom. Advanced undergraduate students will be involved in designing a set of tools, using the SDSS data, to illustrate important scientific principles. These tools will be used in a ""hands-on"" cosmology class for entering non-science majors, in large standard intro ductory physics classes, and will be distributed through existing teacher outreach programs. There will be continued efforts to improve the quality of standard undergraduate teaching at the University of Michigan, and to continue SDSS public information programs and a successful public lecture series. This project is a five year program that will enable a faculty member at the University of Michigan to develop further as an astrophysics researcher and an educator. The grant will support the faculty member, a graduate student, and a number of undergraduates in their analysis of gravitational lensing effects in data to be obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. There is also support to use the SDSS data in the development of new educational materials for use in a variety of classroom situations."|0

Already, experiments like Fermi GST and PAMELA are producing very exciting - though puzzling - results that may be major hints to an unexpectedly rich dark matter sector. There are many possibilities for dramatic discoveries, which will usher in a new era for dark matter and fundamental particle physics. How one combines the complementary information from these disparate measurements into a cohesive picture is not readily apparent. Initially, it is unlikely that an obvious picture will emerge that is more compelling than conventional explanations, such as poorly understood modeling or experimental systematics. Thus, one must be prepared to pose serious questions about the data, the theoretical interpretation, the experimental systematics, and additional modeling assumptions that are not limited by avoidable technical limitations. This award supports a program of physics research built around a unifying approach to large-scale scientific data analysis, initially dealing with data from LHC experiments, in a way that is scalable with respect to complexity of data, experimental apparatuses, and theoretical models. The approach could have profound impact on early standard model physics measurements and the extension to Higgs physics and beyond as well as facilitate communication and cooperation between ATLAS and CMS, between theorists and experimentalists, and among researchers from different disciplines. <br/>In terms of broader impact the key development in this award that enables the scalable approach to large-scale data analysis is applicable beyond the field of particle physics. Experiments as diverse as Fermi GST, HESS, and the IceCube neutrino telescope are already exploring the use of this technology, which is a concrete indication of the broader impacts of the proposed research. Additional impacts follow from a well-integrated educational and outreach component. A portable and professionally-designed exhibit will be constructed for use at the popular New York City World Science Festival street fair, area science fairs, career fairs, and the like. The booth will utilize existing material from the ATLAS outreach group. Additionally, the exhibit will be the basis for a project integrated into a teaching methods course in the Department of Teaching and Learning at NYU. The project will be to design activities for the exhibit itself and to develop and assess physics teaching methods. Thus, the exhibit, the activities, and the assessment of the exhibit will be the culmination of a semester-long project, and those teachers can bring the developed activities to their own schools. Finally, the PI will mentor high-school students from the Harlem Children's Society so that they can understand and operate the demonstrations, thus serving as peer-group liaisons, and role models for under-represented groups in the sciences.|0

Ultimately, this project will address two of the most important questions in extragalactic astronomy and cosmology today: (1) is the Lambda-CDM model correct? and (2) how do the astrophysical processes governing star formation and galactic feedback affect the evolution of galaxies? This can be done because there are now large area surveys in both optical and radio (21-cm) wavelengths, so that studying the stars and gas simultaneously in a statistically significant sample of galaxies in a single volume of space is finally possible.<br/><br/>This study will break new ground in our understanding of the fundamental components of galaxies in the local universe, and will have a legacy value to the entire astronomical community in the form of readily available catalogs containing the combined optical and HI data for more than 30,000 galaxies in the overlap region between the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFALFA) survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). There will also be a longer term impact on the recruitment, training, and mentoring of the next generation of scientists and science teachers. In addition, Dr. Rosenberg will work to increase the number of women and minority physics majors at George Mason University as one of the goals of this project.|0

Together with the Tevatron, this machine promises to<br/>explore the energies relevant to electroweak symmetry breaking, the source of which<br/>remains one of the great mysteries of the field. Solving this mystery will shed light on<br/>the origin of mass for fundamental particles (such as the electron), and on the reason<br/>the weak force is short ranged. Electroweak physics might also hold the key to the<br/>identity of the dark matter of the universe, and its discovery at the LHC is an extremely<br/>exciting possibility. However, it might not be easy to disentangle the signals that we see<br/>at the accelerator. Even though a weakly coupled supersymmetric Standard Model<br/>extension remains an attractive option, recently there have been several interesting<br/>proposals for non-supersymmetric scenarios. These utilize non-perturbative dynamics<br/>both in 4D field theory and in holographically related 5D versions of 4D field theory.<br/>Such extensions of the Standard Model (SM) might result in fairly similar experimental<br/>signatures both to each other and to certain types of supersymmetry. It is therefore very<br/>important that theorists who are familiar with a variety of different mechanisms for<br/>electroweak symmetry breaking continue developing both novel theoretical frameworks,<br/>as well as study possible signatures with close communication with experimentalists. It<br/>will thus be more likely that we shall be prepared for the surprises that nature has in<br/>store for us at the LHC. The PI hence intends to explore options for electroweak<br/>physics with emphasis on models which include forms of strong dynamics, and on ways<br/>to distinguish their experimental signatures at the LHC. In terms of broader impact, the<br/>PI has an established relationship with Needham High School, where he has made<br/>arrangements to give a series of lectures about particle physics, the science lifestyle,<br/>and the opportunities it offers for exploration and communication. The idea is to<br/>encourage young people, and especially women to get excited about theoretical<br/>physics, both through conversation about the experiences of being a theorist, as well as<br/>discussion of new developments in theory research, emphasizing the current<br/>excitement in the field concerning the LHC.|0

However, there is great uncertainty as to what exactly will be seen. Nonetheless, there are strong indications that its discoveries will address fundamental questions. This proposal will leverage the data from this ambitious undertaking and other experiments to primarily explore two questions: What is the identity of the mysterious dark matter that permeates our universe? What is the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking? Disentangling the answers to these questions will be a decade-long program requiring cooperation between theorists and experimentalists. The PI has several particular focuses. One initial focus will be to examining exotic new physics signatures. As more data arrives, the emphasis will shift towards building models that answer these two fundamental questions in a way consistent with data. Deciphering these questions will require an understanding of not only particle physics data, but data from cosmological experiments. Taking advantage of the interplay between the celestial and terrestrial will allow the PI to gain additional insight into the fundamental questions he intends to explore. <br/>Another goal of this proposal is to ensure that the knowledge and excitement generated by current and upcoming discoveries in particle physics are broadly shared: from the general public through graduate students. The outreach effort under this proposal will be two-fold. First, an exhibit on particle physics and the LHC is planned at the Ruthven Exhibit Museum for Natural History in Ann Arbor. This exhibit should reach 20- 30 thousand visitors during its initial run, including over 10,000 school-age students, many from disadvantaged areas. Second, the general public will benefit from a series of Saturday Morning lectures (broadcast to a wider audience on cable television) on the physics of the LHC.|0

The PI also plans to also continue her work to ensure that unexpected physics --- such as that emerging from a possible low-mass hidden sector (or so-called ``Hidden Valley'') --- is not missed in analyses of data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the astrophysics and cosmology side of her work, the PI plans to focus on the indirect detection of dark matter, and on the construction and analysis of various models of neutrino physics.<br/><br/>This activity also includes a major program of education and outreach, with three specific public-outreach activities planned. The first is to develop, in collaboration with the Exhibit Museum for Natural History at the University of Michigan, a segment visualizing dark matter and its detection, on scales from the earth to clusters of galaxies. Such a segment will have a reach of 18,000 annual visitors to the museum planetarium, and many more through distribution to other planetaria nationwide. Second, the PI will present public lectures in a very popular Saturday-morning lecture series at the University of Michigan, discussing the existence of dark matter and the fundamental physics of cosmic anti-matter.

However, it is challenged by two dramatic breakdowns of dimensional analysis---the incredible smallness of the vacuum energy and of the Higgs mass, compared to the characteristic scale of gravity. With the hope of helping to resolve these puzzles, Professor Dubovskiy aims to enrich the effective field theory toolbox with new sophisticated techniques and to come up with and test new radical theoretical ideas beyond the traditional framework. At the same time he will be looking for new observational probes, which may provide new hints on the origin of the Higgs mass and the vacuum energy. The research of Professor Dubovskiy will cover a broad spectrum of physical phenomena, ranging from the superradiant instability of astrophysical black holes as a tool to discover new particles to the dynamics of flux tubes, responsible for the confinement of quarks. <br/><br/>The research that will be funded covers not only a wide range of topics in high energy theory and cosmology, but has an impact throughout the Physics Division. For example, studies of the vacuum structure of string theory has led Prof. Dubovskiy to propose a new type of particle related to the axion, which would constitute the dark matter. Studying the interactions of this dark matter with black holes has led to extraordinary experimental signatures, ranging from astrophysical studies of black hole masses to specific gravitational wave signatures that are in the range accessible to the Advanced Large Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). These will be studied in detail. There are also substantial interrelations with atomic physics and with nuclear physics. One of the other projects will contribute to understanding the dynamics of flux tubes, which hold quarks together in the nucleon.<br/><br/>The award will also fund community outreach activities. Professor Dubovskiy will contribute to the development of the NYU Science Communication Workshop program, which helps train a generation of scientists in effective communication with the public, and the award will support numerous scientists. He also will give presentations on particle physics and cosmology at a local high school. In addition, the research project relies on the active involvement of graduate students and postdocs, thereby bringing junior physicists to the frontiers of fundamental physics research.|0

The pipeline involves obtaining unbiased estimates of statistical and systematic errors, refining theoretical models used to fit the data, performing the fitting, and interpreting the results. A key tool required for every step in the pipeline is cosmological N-body simulations and associated mock galaxy catalogs. Dr. Berlind will complete the LasDamas simulations project and use it to enable the joint modeling of galaxy two-point, three-point, and group statistics in the SDSS.

It pertains to fundamental unanswered questions in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. This award will enable a probe of a very interesting new region of theoretical phase space for viable Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) candidates in the search for dark matter in order to improve our understanding of it: what it is, where it is, how it interacts with Standard Model particles, and what its role is in the evolution and fate of the universe. <br/><br/>The research objective is to either measure a dark matter signal or set a limit on the WIMP-nucleon cross-section for a 60 GeV WIMP mass. This will be reached through the PI's work as a member of the Cold Dark Matter Search (CDMS) collaboration.

The motivation for the search for dark matter comes from our <br/>current understanding of the universe. Over the last ten years, a variety of cosmological <br/>observations have led to the construction of a concordance model of cosmology. In this very <br/>successful model, the universe is made of 4% baryons, which constitute the ordinary matter, <br/>23% nonbaryonic dark matter, which formed all the structures observed today, and 73% <br/>dark energy, a smooth component revealed by its effect on the geometry of the universe. <br/>Understanding the nature of the dark matter and dark energy are the most important <br/>challenges to cosmology. The dark matter could be made of so-called Weakly Interacting <br/>Massive Particles (WIMPs), which could have been produced in a very early phase of the <br/>universe. These Big Bang relics are particularly interesting because they are also predicted <br/>in particle physics theories going beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. They <br/>can be detected in the laboratory by searching for nuclear recoils produced when WIMPs <br/>scatter off nuclei in a target detector. Because the predicted event rates are very low <br/>(smaller than one event per kg detector material and day), and the deposited energies <br/>are tiny, massive, ultra-low background experiments are needed in order to detect these <br/>hypothetical particles. Liquid xenon has many advantages as a dark matter detector. The <br/>high-density and high atomic number allow to build a compact and self-shielded detector, <br/>while the simultaneous measurement of the charge and light signal after a WIMP scatters <br/>off a Xe-nucleus provides an efficient method to discriminate against background noise from <br/>natural radioactivity and cosmic ray interactions. The proposed research has the ultimate <br/>goal of building a large liquid Xe dark matter experiment in an underground laboratory. <br/>A first, 10 kg liquid Xe dark matter prototype has been approved and will be installed at <br/>the Gran Sasso Laboratory in 2006. At the University of Florida, we have built a smaller, <br/>3 kg prototype, with the goal of calibrating the light and charge output of the detector and <br/>establishing its discrimination power at low energies by using a neutron beam at the UF <br/>tandem accelerator. <br/><br/>The main focus of the educational part of the proposal is to mentor female students in <br/>bridging the transition from high school to college and from college to a PhD program on <br/>physics. A series of talks will be given at local high schools with the goal of recruiting female <br/>students to UF and to a yearly 7 week summer program in which they are actively involved <br/>in research in a physics lab. A mentoring program for female undergraduate and graduate <br/>students at UF will be established. It will be organized both as small-group tutoring, by <br/>pairing one undergraduate and one graduate student and having them meet regularly, as <br/>well as in large group activities, such as monthly meetings with a female professor from <br/>UF or abroad, and social events. Such meetings, along with office hours for female physics <br/>students have been offered since fall 2004, and so far were very well attended. The ultimate <br/>goal of the educational component will be to increase the number of women who obtain an <br/>advanced degree in physics, and who will continue to have a successful career in science.|0

Today, extremely sensitive instruments operate in the high energy (AGILE and FERMI in the range 100 MegaelectronVolt (MeV) - 100 GigaelectronVolt (GeV)) and very high energy (VHE) (HAWC, HESS, MAGIC, VERITAS at energies greater than 100 GeV;) regimes simultaneously. Among the most exciting results from VERITAS are the detection of emission from the Crab Pulsar above 100 GeV (requiring the presence of a new emission component), the discovery of gamma-ray emission from a starburst galaxy, M82 (firmly associating cosmic-ray acceleration with star-forming regions), and the detection of correlated variability in the radio and Teraelectronvolt (TeV) regimes in radio galaxies (helping to constrain the emission to be originating within the jet collimation region). The upper limit on the gamma-ray emission from the Segue 1 dwarf galaxy set by VERITAS rules out most of the leptophilic dark matter parameter space favored by recent cosmic-ray positron measurements. A major upgrade to the VERITAS cameras during summer 2012 introduced high-quantum-efficiency photo multiplier tubes to lower the energy threshold of the array by 30%, and the array will be further augmented by the arrival in 2015 of a prototype 10 meter class Schwarzschild-Couder telescope under development for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). <br/><br/>Following the recent VERITAS hardware upgrade, great promise for further improving the science potential of the instrument comes from a focus on data analysis. This CAREER award provides support for developing major improvements in VERITAS data analysis methods aimed at lowering the analysis threshold, improving angular and energy resolution, and increasing background discrimination. It will also support analysis of VERITAS data to search for dark matter signals from the Galactic Halo, Fermi unassociated sources, and related targets, as well as studies of Galactic accelerators of cosmic rays. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The science of VERITAS and CTA - searching for dark matter and investigating the most powerful cosmic accelerators - has broad applications to both astro- and particle physics, and addresses questions that can capture the public's imagination. Group members will share that excitement via public lectures at area high schools and to groups in the local Morningside Heights and Harlem areas of Manhattan and Westchester County, and by engaging undergraduates and area high school students in the group's research activities. As a centerpiece to tie together these outreach activities, the group plans to develop a Visitor Center at Nevis Labs that will occupy both physical and virtual spaces and provide a focal point for visiting groups to learn about the history and current research at Nevis.|0

The goals of the program are to lead discoveries on the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN and to promote teaching, learning, and sharing the excitement of the research with the broader community.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The scientific goal of the program is to discover new particles that explain unification of the fundamental forces and particles, the mystery of dark matter and energy, and the lack of antimatter in our universe. The research being proposed will maximize the scientific value of the CMS experiment at the LHC. In the first two years of the program novel techniques developed by the PI will be used to optimize the detector for the discoveries through careful alignment analysis of its components. In the subsequent years, the optimized detector will be used as a tool to discover new mysterious particles. The unprecedented level of the energy scale of the new collider facility will open an extensive range of physics topics. A new mysterious Higgs particle is expected to be responsible for the property of mass of all particles. The angular analysis of its decay will be a way to understand its origin. The PI has already tools to disentangle complicated angular structures through his discoveries in the area of quark flavor physics. The Higgs may not be alone, and a more general symmetry may be necessary to explain the fundamental laws of physics. A popular symmetry predicts heavy supersymmetric particles. The research direction during the subsequent years of the program will be guided by the first data. Discovery of new particles at the energy frontier will depend on the ability to distinguish them from an enormous background of random particles produced in the high-energy collisions. Understanding the alignment of thousands of silicon sensors which track the particle paths is necessary to achieve micron precision and becomes the decisive factor in success of the program. The PI plans new procedures for alignment analysis of the CMS silicon tracking system using combination of the optical survey measurements and information from tracks. The PI brings this advanced technique from his pioneering studies in the quark flavor experiment and builds on expertise of the Johns Hopkins group in the CMS silicon detectors.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The proposed research has a strong educational component. It will provide training for graduate students and allow undergraduate students to participate in research. The PI plans to develop hands-on demonstrations of elementary particles and other outreach activities through the QuarkNet program, annual Johns Hopkins Physics Fair, and collaboration with the Maryland Science Center. Collaboration with the Science Center has been funded by NSF from the EPSI grant.

It also aims to integrate research in experimental condensed matter physics and development of a unique physics educational program at Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T). New methods will be used to grow perfect bulk insulating TIs and to fabricate large surface-to-volume ratio of TI nanowire arrays. These perfect topological materials are necessary for Dirac surface current detection which is important for both new physics exploration such as studies of Majorana fermion and axion electrodynamics, and technological applications such as spintronic and quantum computing devices. Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, Aharonov-Bohm effect and Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak interference on the perfectly grown TIs will be performed to estimate surface Dirac electron effective mass and decay length. Surface resistivity measurements under magnetic fields up to 45 T will then be carried out for the investigation of fractional quantum Hall effect which is a big quest in the field concerning the role of interactions and strong correlations in topological states of matter. <br/><br/>****Non-Technical Abstract****<br/>Topological insulator (TI) is a new quantum material which has insulating property in its bulk but has high conductivity of electrons on its surface. This surface conducting state is predicted to be a solution for future computing technology. However, surface transport measurements are challenging due to the imperfections of the current existing TIs. A new synthesis technique that utilizes a reduced confining reaction space will be applied to grow perfect bulk insulating crystals in order to permit surface current detection. This electronic transport detection of the surface electrons or the surface Dirac state is necessary for heat dissipation-less spintronic devices where electron spin manipulation can be performed by interfacing a perfect TI and a superconductor for potential fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. Besides, TIs can act as a bridge to bring together high energy and condensed matter physicists to search for long-sought particle such as the Majorana fermion i.e. a fermion which is its own anti-particle and an intermediate particle for electric and magnetic field interactions called the axion which could provide a clue to the mystery of dark matter in cosmology. This CAREER grant also helps to integrate the material synthesis in solid state physics course taught in S&T and to present physics shows targeted to local K-12 students.|0

Understanding this dark matter has become one of the more central problems in astronomy and cosmology. A number of observations indicate that the predominant form of the dark matter is nonbaryonic, presumably in the form of elementary particles produced in the early universe. Weakly Interactive Massive Particles form a particularly interesting generic class of candidates as there appears to be a convergence between cosmology and particle physics. The direct observation of the interaction of WIMPs in a terrestrial detector would be of tremendous importance to particle physics and cosmology. The observed WIMPs would be particles that reflect physics beyond the Standard Model of strong and electroweak interactions, and the identification of these WIMPs would solve the central problem of dark matter and help us understand the evolution of the early universe and the formation of structure.<br/><br/>Because of a long development effort funded both by the National Science Foundation (through the Center for Particle Astrophysics) and the Department Of Energy, the sensor technology exists to provide a great step forward in this type of search, giving the best change for a positive result. The simultaneous measurement of the phonons and the ionization produced by the WIMP interactions provides a powerful discrimination against radioactive background, and this technique is now being utilized at Stanford, in the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search Experiment (CDMS I).<br/><br/>This award, which is being supportred jointly by the Division of Astronomical Sciences, the Division of Physics, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, will support construction and operation of a second generation experiment (CDMS II) at a deep site in the Soudan mine in northern Minnesota.|0

This project addresses the question of the nature of dark matter in the Universe with an experimental search for Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) using two-phase xenon detectors. This group is currently operating at the 100 kg mass scale with the XENON100 experiment which has replaced the XENON10 prototype in the same shield and location at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory. The worldwide race towards direct dark matter detection has been dramatically accelerated by the fast evolution of detectors based on noble liquids. They have shifted the scale of target mass from a few to tens of kilograms, while reducing the overall gamma/beta background to less than 0.001 events/kg/keV/day, much lower than scintillator and cryogenic bolometer detectors. Despite being only a prototype, XENON10 has shown the potential of two-phase Xe detectors for dark matter searches, bringing the XENON program to the forefront of the field. <br/><br/>This award will provide funds to continue the XENON program for 2 more years to complete the dark matter search with the current XENON100 detector within 2009, and to realize an upgraded detector by early 2010 in the same shield and location. Additionally, XENON100 has a robust possibility to address questions related to the DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation signature, shedding new light on this controversial result. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the XENON science program addresses questions about the fundamental properties of the Universe and has all the ingredients to captivate the interest and imagination of students and the general public alike.

One possibility motivated by other considerations in elementary particle physics is that dark matter consists of undiscovered elementary particles. Axions and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are two possibilities. The thermal motion of the WIMPS comprising the dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy and the earth should result in WIMP-nuclear collisions of sufficient energy to be observable by sensitive laboratory apparatus.<br/><br/>This award is to develop and deploy a small liquid argon detector that has high sensitivity for direct detection of WIMP collisions. This detector, DarkSide-50, builds on past experience and introduces innovative features that will allow it to operate in a background-free mode and thereby achieve a significant science result in spite of its relatively small size. At the same time, this detector will serve as a prototype for a future multi-ton detector. The main innovations being introduced:<br/>- Underground argon depleted in radioactive 39Ar;<br/>- Low background, high-quantum-efficiency QUPID photo-detectors; and<br/>- A compact high-efficiency external veto for neutrons.<br/>These innovations, together with the powerful two-parameter background rejection features of argon will result in a detector of unprecedented background-free performance. DarkSide-50 will either detect WIMP dark matter or exclude a substantial fraction of the favored parameter space. DarkSide-50 will benefit from the facility for extraction and refinement of depleted argon, independently funded by the NSF through a grant to Princeton University. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: this activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission in a variety of ways: (1) it will offer an excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will have a chance to contribute to the success of a cutting edge project in fundamental science and advanced engineering; (2) it will benefit society by developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging; (3) it will support continued development of successful E&O programs such as the Princeton-Abruzzo-South Dakota summer school for high school students.|0

It will examine the weak interactions, responsible for many natural phenomena, and seek the origin of the masses of the known fundamental particles, known to arise from a Higgs mechanism whose precise nature remains unclear. The LHC might also shed light on dark matter, and might revolutionize our understanding of space-time, through discovery of extra dimensions or Supersymmetry. A full LHC research program requires experts who can work at and across the interface between theory and experiment. This grant proposal is aimed at strengthening this interface at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) and Rutgers University theory groups, which already work closely with the Rutgers and Princeton University experimental groups and Princeton theory group. The purpose is to augment their LHC research programs in order to close the scientific gap located at the Theory/Experiment Interface, by hiring and hosting experts who can provide tools and knowledge required by both theorists and experimentalists working on LHC physics. This will greatly expand the range of LHC research possible at these institutions, especially assisting with personnel-intensive activities including standard model background studies, development of Monte Carlo tools, and investigations of search strategies for new physics. The PIs will be involved in both developing new models to describe Beyond the Standard Model Physics, as well as creating an effective theory approach for analyzing and interpreting directly the results coming from LHC. The proposed research includes studies on background removal, using Monte Carlo tools.<br/>If a novel signal is seen at the LHC, neither a model-independent approach nor a fully model-dependent approach is appropriate. The PIs propose that once a signal is seen at LHC, they will proceed to build a ""model fragment"", which in many cases will take the form of an ""on-shell effective theory"" (OSET). Model fragments were used by the PIs in their successful analysis at the first LHC Olympics workshop, and were developed further into a Monte Carlo tool for wider use. The essential idea is to build a semi-consistent theoretical framework that makes predictions for LHC signals without requiring a fully consistent TeV-scale theory, or in the case of an OSET, possibly without even a fully consistent effective Lagrangian. The PIs will also investigate the Effects of Multiple Soft Jets on Reconstruction and Analysis. The broader impact is to create the nucleus of an LHC center on the East Coast. The IAS and Rutgers, along with Princeton, will form the nucleus of such a center, helping to anchor and enhance the diffuse but substantial research program on the east coast, which is currently scattered around many institutions.. In particular, by training new students and broadening the postdocs at the Theory/Experiment Interface, it would help, over time, to strengthen the entire US particle physics community. Also, by hosting training and research workshops, it would directly benefit other institutions, particularly in the local and regional neighborhood. Most directly, the quick-reaction workshops would foster a more rapid response from the US community to events at the LHC. The PIs also plan a series of training exercises based on the successful ""LHC Olympics"" model to help in the process of training young students and in retraining postdocs from more formal areas of high-energy theory."|0

Placing the detectors deep underground greatly reduces cosmic ray backgrounds, while large active and passive shielding minimizes the background from radioactivity in the rock of the underground caverns. What remains, however, is the radioactivity inside or on the surface of the detector components. The underground physics community strives to identify and develop materials with radioactive contamination at permissible levels, and to remove radioactive contaminants from materials, but each such material represents a separate dedicated research and development effort. A direct method to establish the radioactive contamination in materials is to measure the emitted gamma radiation directly through gamma ray spectroscopy. <br/><br/>This team has access to two high purity germanium detectors in the Kimballton Underground Facility and access to the lowest background germanium detector in the world, NRL-1 at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. Part of this proposal is to use these three detectors to perform material assay on items needed for experiments. Several techniques have been developed to directly measure isotopic abundances and infer the activity. One of these methods is Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), which can measure isotopic concentrations at the part per trillion level. It is planned to make a comparison of ICP-MS and direct gamma-ray spectroscopy at levels near those required for planned experiments. <br/><br/>Radioactive radon in the air can create radioactive surface contamination on detector components. Although it is possible to create gases with a very low radon concentration, human contact with a detector during construction, assembly, and operation requires an air atmosphere. Underground laboratories will need to have radon removed from the laboratory air. The final part of this proposal is to develop the technology needed to create a radon scrubber for removing the radon from air, and for establishing the limitations to this technology. <br/><br/>Knowledge and expertise in low levels of radiation detection and radon mitigation has direct coupling to occupational health, national security, radiation medicine, etc. This program will also expand the knowledge base for underground physics in the U.S. that will transfer to DUSEL, and develop a new generation of physicists searching for the rarest events and weak interactions.|0

The observations of HAWC will probe the most extreme environments in the Universe, providing a unique view of non-thermal processes in the Galaxy and beyond. The key science goals of HAWC are to: (a) Measure the spectrum of Galactic sources to the highest energies; (b) Map the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission from 1 TeV to 100 TeV, measuring the cosmic-ray flux and spectrum across the Galaxy; (c) Study transient emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN); (d) Monitor the sky for 100 GeV emission from gamma-ray bursts; and (e) Search for new TeV physics with HAWC's unbiased sky survey. HAWC measurements have the potential to shed light on the fundamental symmetries of nature, including the search for Lorentz violation at extreme energies, the search for the dark matter in the universe, and the direct detection of massive relic particles.

These structures of known or assumed remnants of satellite accretion, have long-lived, coherent tidal features that can be used to accurately model the Galactic gravitational potential, as well as the characteristics of the original satellite. However, such modeling studies have been limited by the meager available kinematical data over large angles along the tidal features. While radial-velocity programs have just recently begun to address this problem for the few known Galactic tidal tails, no systemic survey has begun to address the transverse (tangential) velocities (i.e., absolute proper motions), which contain twice as much dynamical information. Without this information, dynamical models remain poorly constrained, and therefore limited to describing merely a range of possible events, rather than providing an accurate description of the real event.<br/><br/>In this collaborative project, Dr. Dana Dinescu at Yale University and Dr. Steven Majewski, at the University of Virginia, will undertake a deep, high-precision absolute and relative proper-motion survey that will sample more than 50 lines of sight in the Selected Areas designated by Kapteyn for Galactic structure studies in 1906; indeed, the photographic plates taken at that time by Kapteyn and colleagues will be used as first epoch material. Current proper-motion programs do not achieve this precision at a similar magnitude limit, and are thus limited in detecting and characterizing distant halo substructure. The combination of proper-motion precision, depth,<br/>and sky coverage of this project will not be surpassed until the upcoming astrometric satellite<br/>missions GAIA and SIM. The data from these missions may be available in 2015 and 2020 respectively, while results from this project will be available in the next 3-4 years. The proper motions will be complemented by radial velocities, distance and metallicity estimates from photometric and spectroscopic work as well as from overlapping surveys like 2MASS, QUEST, SDSS and RAVE. Examples of intended applications of the data include: 1) Determining the extent and orbital motion of the highly obscured Monoceros, anticenter structure both above and below the Galactic plane, 2) Characterizing the transverse motion of the Sagittarius tidal streams. 3) Detecting and characterizing additional substructures in the halo of the Milky Way. 4) Determining the kinematical properties of the numerous thick disk and halo stars in the fields as a function of Galacto-centric distance. There are only a few deep, precise (pencil-beam-type) proper-motion data-sets that are centered on Galactic field stars rather than on a globular cluster or a dwarf spheroidal. This project will substantially increase the number of pencil-beam-type data-sets and therefore systematically probe our Galaxy in more than 50 distinct lines-of-sight. What makes the project possible is the combination of original 60-inch Mt. Wilson telescope plates taken in 1909 with matching Du Pont 2.5-m plates, thus yielding a 90 year baseline of excellent plate scale material. This research will contribute to an accurate model of the interaction of our Galaxy with its former satellites, and help characterize the Galaxy's satellite system. Also, the kinematical data of debris stars have the potential of measuring the lumpiness of the dark matter halo. These two issues are relevant for cold dark matter simulations that currently overpredict, by two orders of magnitude, the number of dark matter halos relative to the number of observed satellites of the Milky Way. <br/>***|0

One possibility motivated by other considerations in elementary particle physics is that dark matter consists of undiscovered elementary particles; Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are one possibility. Evidence for WIMPs that could constitute dark matter may come from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN or from sensitive astronomical instruments that detect radiation produced by WIMP-WIMP annihilations in galaxy halos. The orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nuclear collisions of sufficient energy to be observable by sensitive laboratory apparatus. <br/><br/>This award will provide funding for research and development steps to support DarkSide-G2, a second-generation (""G2"") direct WIMP search using a liquid argon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with an active mass of 3.3 tons. Liquid argon is a promising medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile (""pulse shape"") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. This is one of the most powerful background rejection factors among all dark matter detectors, and when combined with the measurement of ionization, background rejection is even further enhanced. The performance of a ton-scale or larger liquid argon TPC would be limited by the high rate of 39-Ar beta decays if atmospheric argon was used. DarkSide-G2 will use argon collected from underground sources which has been shown to have 39-Ar content lower than atmospheric argon by at least a factor of 150. These funds will allow the groups to carry out the detailed mechanical design work necessary to ensure the functionality of the detector, develop necessary high voltage and data acquisition elements, and develop and identify the extremely radiopure detector components and techniques necessary to maximize the sensitivity of the experiment.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: This activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission in a variety of ways: (1) it will offer a continuing opportunity for the training of students, who will have a chance to contribute a cutting-edge project in fundamental science and advanced engineering; (2) it will benefit society by developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging; and (3) it will support continued development of successful E&O programs such as the LNGS-South Dakota-Princeton summer school for high school students."|0

The First Contiguous Spectroscopic Survey of the True Outer Halo.|NULL|The long dynamical times and radial extent of our stellar halo preserves a chance to trace the history of mass assembly of both the stellar and dark matter components of our Galaxy. Most of what we know about the outer halo is learned from stars that happen to pass nearby. If the outer halo is, as we expect, dynamically young and not well mixed, the motion of such stars may not tell the full story of the recent accretion history of the Galaxy. Dr. Rockosi (at the University of California Santa Cruz) and Dr. Morrison (at Case Western Reserve University)work on a spectroscopic survey of red giant branch stars in the outer halo, done as part of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). This is the dark time survey in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III project. The BOSS spectrograph improvements and large area coverage of an area of about 10,000 square degrees allow a contiguous survey of the outer reaches of our Galaxy. The complete sample will provide kinematics, metallicities, and alpha element to iron abundance ratios for approximately 1000 stars with a median distance of 50 kpc, providing a true outer halo sample. The alpha elements such as O, Mg, and Si are mainly produced in supernovae and trace the chemical evolution of the halo. <br/>The outer halo sample will be used to measure the halo stellar radial density profile, metallicity and alpha element abundance gradients to beyond 100 kpc from the center of the Galaxy, as well as identify and characterize substructure in stellar density, kinematics and chemical abundance. From this we can learn the fractional contribution of stellar accretion to the outer halo, as well as the mass and orbit distributions and star formation histories of the halo progenitors. Comparison of these measurements in the outer halo to existing measurements in the surviving dwarf spheroidal galaxies and in the inner halo can be used to infer the mass accretion history and stellar population evolution of our Galaxy and its progenitors through time. All SDSS data become public in a timely manner, giving a rich and in many ways still unexplored resource to astronomers. The principal investigators have led the stellar surveys in the SDSS projects from proposals through data releases. All have been actively involved for the past six years in the calibrations needed before these data can be used reliably for stars, which included improving the flux calibration of the SDSS spectra, to tests of the stellar parameters pipeline to the painstaking observation and analysis of well-studied open and globular clusters.<br/>Minority students remain a small proportion of graduating PhDs. Case astronomy is partnering with the very successful Fisk/Vanderbilt Masters Bridge Program for minorities so that their graduates can enter the Case Western Reserve University astronomy PhD program in the same way that they currently enter the Vanderbilt PhD program; effectively as third-year graduate students. The Case program for Women in Science and Engineering (co-founded by the PI) is now in its ninth year of encouraging women undergraduates to stay in science. Dr. Rockosi leads many projects to develop facility instrumentation at Keck and Lick Observatory. These instruments are available via public access to Keck, and the Lick Observatory projects provide a technology development platform for adaptive optics and other instrumentation research. Dr. Rockosi and her research group participate in the Santa Cruz Institute for Science and Engineering Educators, which introduces graduate students and postdocs to inquiry-based learning techniques while running workshops designed to encourage underrepresented minority students to go on for advanced degrees in STEM fields.

Combining optical and near-infrared data, the team will estimate how the rate of star formation and the stellar masses of galaxies changed over this period, which covers almost half of cosmic history.

The project consists of four main science goals. (1) Constrain the spatial distribution of galaxies inside dark matter halos in the local universe. Using redshift data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the proposing team will measure the projected two-point correlation function, the angular correlation function, and the surface density profile of galaxies in groups and clusters. They will model these statistics to constrain the density profile of galaxies in dark halos, using both analytic models and numerical models constructed from cosmological N-body simulations. (2) Extend the above analysis to higher redshift by using data from the new Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Modeling the correlation functions will reveal the recent evolution in the spatial distribution of galaxies within halos. (3) Refine the proposers' semi-analytic model for the evolution of dark matter subhalos under the influence of merging, improving the analytic prescription for mass loss and including the role of baryonic matter. (4) By comparing the improved halo model to the clustering statistics, constrain the star formation and star stripping efficiencies for galaxies merging with larger halos.

It will examine the weak interactions, responsible for many natural phenomena, and seek the origin of the masses of the known fundamental particles, known to arise from a Higgs mechanism whose precise nature remains unclear. The LHC might also shed light on dark matter, and might revolutionize our understanding of space-time, through discovery of extra dimensions or Supersymmetry. A full LHC research program requires experts who can work at and across the interface between theory and experiment. <br/><br/>This project is aimed at strengthening this interface at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) and Rutgers University theory groups, which already work closely with the Rutgers and Princeton University experimental groups and Princeton theory group. The purpose is to augment their LHC research programs in order to close the scientific gap located at the Theory/Experiment Interface, by hiring and hosting experts who can provide tools and knowledge required by both theorists and experimentalists working on LHC physics. This will greatly expand the range of LHC research possible at these institutions, especially assisting with personnel-intensive activities including standard model background studies, development of Monte Carlo tools, and investigations of search strategies for new physics. The PIs will be involved in both developing new models to describe Beyond the Standard Model Physics, as well as creating an effective theory approach for analyzing and interpreting directly the results coming from LHC. The proposed research includes studies on background removal, using Monte Carlo tools. If a novel signal is seen at the LHC, neither a model-independent approach nor a fully model-dependent approach is appropriate. The PIs propose that once a signal is seen at LHC, they will proceed to build a ""model fragment"", which in many cases will take the form of an ""on-shell effective theory"" (OSET). Model fragments were used by the PIs in their successful analysis at the first LHC Olympics workshop, and were developed further into a Monte Carlo tool for wider use. The essential idea is to build a semi-consistent theoretical framework that makes predictions for LHC signals without requiring a fully consistent TeV-scale theory, or in the case of an OSET, possibly without even a fully consistent effective Lagrangian. The PIs will also investigate the Effects of Multiple Soft Jets on Reconstruction and Analysis. <br/><br/>The broader impact is to create the nucleus of an LHC center on the East Coast. The IAS and Rutgers, along with Princeton, will form the nucleus of such a center, helping to anchor and enhance the diffuse but substantial research program on the East Coast, which is currently scattered around many institutions. In particular, by training new students and broadening the postdocs at the Theory/Experiment Interface, it would help, over time, to strengthen the entire US particle physics community. Also, by hosting training and research workshops, it would directly benefit other institutions, particularly in the local and regional neighborhood. Most directly, the quick-reaction workshops would foster a more rapid response from the US community to events at the LHC. The PIs also plan a series of training exercises based on the successful ""LHC Olympics"" model to help in the process of training young students and in retraining postdocs from more formal areas of high-energy theory."|0

The most promising candidate for dark matter is a new weakly interacting particle with a mass near the electroweak scale, suggesting a tantalizing connection with electroweak symmetry breaking. The PI intends to investigate this connection by developing and exploring models beyond the Standard Model with unusual particle dark matter candidates, and calculating the astrophysical detection prospects as well as their novel collider signals. Remarkable dark matter detection experiments are now underway which have already provided unprecedented clues to the properties of dark matter. Very recent results, including the reconfirmation of the DAMA annual modulation, the PAMELA positron ratio excess, and others, are strongly suggestive of electroweak scale candidates with unusual properties. Simultaneously, the start of the large hadron collider this year will revolutionize our knowledge of the electroweak scale. The PI intends to exploit these opportunities to actively participate in uncovering the nature and identity of dark matter. As to broader implacts, the PI plans a series of integrated outreach programs afforded by the strong public appeal of the physics of the Universe to broaden the impact of this proposal. The PI has begun a working relationship with South Eugene High School with plans to expand students' opportunities for research through advising their Senior Research Project. The PI is proposing a new public lecture series that will bring forefront researchers to Oregon. Using the University of Oregon's recently enlarged Portland facility, the public outreach effort would be directed at Oregon's largest population center and combined with new opportunities to have leading researchers visit with undergraduates at traditional liberal arts colleges such as Reed College.<br/>This program allows opportunities for undergraduates of wide backgrounds to be inquisitive and become excited by research as well as developing ideas for senior thesis research projects."|0

These concerns join other fundamental unsolved problems - the nature of dark matter, the origin of the baryon asymmetry, and the fundamental origin of inflation or other physics of the early universe. A central part of the proposal is the development of a suite of tests to (a) establish the theoretical viability of dark energy and modified gravity models and (b) to distinguish such models from one another and from the default case of a cosmological constant. The P.I. will investigate the extent to which there are relationships between modified gravity and dark energy models; the P.I. will map out and explore the territory of possible modifications to gravity with the potential to drive late-time cosmic acceleration; and the P.I. will perform a general study of cosmological perturbation theory in modified source gravity and on a class of models in which the <br/>Gravitational action is a general function of curvature invariants. <br/>The P.I. further proposes to carry out a systematic and comprehensive analysis of coupled <br/>dark energy-matter models, focusing on the stability of these models. The P.I. also proposes a systematic study of the cosmological consequences of models arising <br/>from compactified higher dimensional theories of particle physics and gravity; in particular, whether there are specific signatures that might be accessible to future <br/>supernovae studies, lensing surveys, large-scale structure measurements and collider experiments. <br/>The dominant broader impact of the proposed research is in public science education; bringing cutting edge science to the public, including populations traditionally underrepresented in physics. <br/>The P.I. has been a co-P.I. on Cosmic Connections, an NSF-funded project to construct modern cosmology exhibits for display in the Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science and Technology in Syracuse. The P.I. also organizes a public lecture series - Saturday Morning Physics - to share the ideas and excitement of cutting edge modern physics with people with no previous science education. Further, the P.I. has co-founded and organizes Café Scientifique Syracuse.

Most of the matter is in a form unknown to us, and can be detected only through its gravitational pull. The nature of this ``Dark Matter'' is the single most interesting problem in contemporary theoretical physics, and its study involves the amalgamation of information from different disciplines, such as particle physics, astronomy, and cosmology. The present project aims to constrain the properties of this elusive dark matter by looking at ``bias'', the difference between the statistical properties of visible and dark matter.<br/><br/>According to current theories of structure formation, small initial fluctuations in the early Universe grew under the influence of gravity until the large-scale structures which, we see at the present day, formed. It appears that galaxies formed where the underlying dark matter concentrated in clumps (called halos). Thus, the present distribution of galaxies depends both on the distribution of dark matter and on the efficiency with which dark matter halos turn into galaxies. Novel statistical measures developed by Dr. Szapudi and his collaborators will be used to characterize the present-day distribution of galaxies using data from on-going wide field surveys (e.g., the Sloan Digital Sky Survey) which encompass up to a million objects. Then the theory of bias will be applied to these measured distributions to constrain the distribution of the underlying dark matter. This distribution, in turn can be used to test predictions from the various phenomenological and fundamental theories which have been developed to describe the ""Dark Matter"".<br/>***"|0

The observations of HAWC will probe the most extreme environments in the Universe, providing a unique view of non-thermal processes in the Galaxy and beyond. The key science goals of HAWC are to: (a) Measure the spectrum of Galactic sources to the highest energies; (b) Map the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission from 1 TeV to 100 TeV measuring the cosmic-ray flux and spectrum across the Galaxy; (c) Study transient emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN); (d) Monitor the sky for 100 GeV emission from gamma-ray bursts; and (e) Search for new TeV physics with HAWC's unbiased sky survey. HAWC measurements have the potential to shed light on the fundamental symmetries of nature, including the search for Lorentz violation at extreme energies, the search for the dark matter in the universe, and the direct detection of massive relic particles.<br/><br/>HAWC is an array consisting of 250 large water tanks, each instrumented with three photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) mounted on the bottom of the tank. The tanks will cover an area of ~20,000 square meters. The expanded detection, increased altitude and optical isolation of the detector elements lead to a 15-fold increase in sensitivity relative to Milagro, which performed the deepest wide-field survey of the TeV sky to date. Refinement of the design and cost has been achieved through prototyping and deploying a test array at the HAWC site. The cost estimate and design sensitivity have stayed roughly constant through the development process. The goal is to begin taking data while the array is under construction and to be online within approximately three years. This will allow HAWC to run while the Fermi mission is ongoing.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: HAWC is an all-sky instrument that will have the sensitivity to extend the measurement of satellite-discovered sources to TeV energies.

The collaboration has over the past year, introduced measures against radon percolation into the active volume, this together with longer exposures have improved the estimated reach of the technique by approximately two orders of magnitude.

The design is to be based on a modest extrapolation of the system already developed and tested in the 60 kg chamber. The ultimate target mass is only limited by the commercial availability of large synthetic silica vessels. This is not considered to be an impediment, since for other reasons of convenience, safety and cost, a possible extension into the multi-ton experiment at DUSEL can very well take form as a small array of such modules. An initial 500-kg module shielded by a modest thickness vertical water tank would be a perfectly adequate as part of the initial set of DUSEL experiments. The relatively low cost of this approach to dark matter detection leaves an option of larger masses as a realistic possibility. <br/><br/>The boarder impact of this proposal will include new opportunities for undergraduate participation in research in addition to graduate student and postdoc education. On the technical front, the application of the COUPP technique to cargo screening for fissile materials could have an significant impact.

Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs exist and are the dark matter, then their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of cryogenic phonon-mediated devices to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. With this powerful technology, they have operated for four years the CDMS-II experiment with 30 detectors deep underground in the Soudan mine in Minnesota, and obtained the best limit worldwide at high WIMP masses. This award will fund the base program of this group to focus primarily on detector characterization and optimization, rapid-turnaround initial cryogenic screening of full-scale CDMS production detectors, rapid-turnaround Tc-testing of tungsten film samples from the detector production line, detector fabrication support, collaborative work with scientists and technical staff at new CDMS detector fabrication and substrate polishing facilities, and assistance with CDMS-related materials analysis. <br/><br/>Not only are its scientific results important for astrophysics and particle physics, but its technological development will also push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors, whose applications are increasingly widespread. In addition to working with students from Santa Clara University (SCU), an undergraduate institution, the PI actively mentors undergraduates, graduate students and junior research staff at other CDMS institutions. The close proximity of SCU to Stanford, UC Berkeley and SLAC makes close collaborations with these groups particularly easy - and tremendously beneficial to SCU students. Lastly, the SCU group does some outreach with K-12 students in the San Francisco Bay Area and supports the public outreach program at Soudan as part of the SuperCDMS collaboration.|0

One principal conclusion of the APS Multidivisional Study stated: ?We recommend, as a high priority, a phased program of sensitive searches for neutrinoless nuclear double-beta decay.? NLDB decay is the only practical way to determine if neutrinos are their own antiparticles and it is the most sensitive test of lepton-number conservation, an important symmetry in elementary-particle physics. In addition, if neutrinos are Majorana particles, an accurate measurement of the NLDB-decay half-life might well be possible; it would yield the effective Majorana mass of the electron neutrino which, when combined with the results of neutrino oscillation experiments, would determine all three neutrino-mass eigenvalues. <br/><br/>This award will provide funds to support the USC group to continue their involvement in the Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE), an array of 988 TeO2 bolometers, at Gran Sasso (LNGS), Italy. CUORE is the successor to CUORICINO, currently the most sensitive NLDB decay experiment in operation. The USC team is responsible for the procurement and production of the complete CUORE electronic system starting at the detector and ending at the input of data acquisition system. The PI is the U.S. Task Coordinator for the construction of CUORE-0, the first of the 19 towers of CUORE. It will serve as a test of the specific construction procedures of CUORE, and will operate in the CUORICINO cryostat. This will yield physics results beyond those of CUORICINO. <br/><br/>For Broader Impacts, these proposed tasks provide excellent Ph.D. research topics. The PI?s low-background experiments in NLDB decay and Cold Dark Matter have provided dissertation topics for many students, with more research students currently at various stages of their programs.|0

However, these neutrino oscillation data cannot yield the mass scale of neutrinos, nor can they be used to determine that neutrinos are Majorana particles. If the mass of the electron neutrino is ¡Ü 0.2 eV, and neutrinos are Majorana particles, neutrino-less double beta decay is the only hope of determining the mass scale and it is the only practical experiment for determining that they are Majorana particles. Knowledge of the mass would determine what role, if any, neutrinos play as Hot Dark Matter candidates, and if they are Majorana particles, this opens the door to leptogenesis as a possible mechanism for the tiny particle over anti-particle asymmetry in the early universe that would have led to the particle dominated universe observed today.<br/><br/>Hence, CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events), as a neutrino-less double beta decay experiment, has significant discovery potential. This proposal is a request to support the University of South Carolina (USC) in: 1) the first phase of the construction of the 130-Te CUORE experiment; the USC group proposes to take responsibility for the production of the electronic components necessary to instrument the 988 TeO2 bolometers; and 2) an R&D program to determine the technical feasibility and cost of constructing CUORE with Te enriched to 85% in 130-Te. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project relate to development of ultralow background Ge detectors, transferred now to commercial companies. The low background technology has been used to produce an ultra low background Ge detector for the Savannah River Low-Background Counting Facility. This facility is used for US government work related to Homeland Defense and National Defense.|0

Understanding the nature and properties of dark matter is fundamental for furthering the fields of cosmology, astrophysics, and particle physics and for shaping our understanding of the makeup of the Universe. A leading theoretical candidate for this dark matter is a class of particles known as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which would have been produced at the time of the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to detect these particles via their scattering from atomic nuclei have significantly matured and are possibly within a few years of making a definitive detection. The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare WIMP interactions and distinguish them from backgrounds. <br/><br/>This award will provide support for the continuation of the University of Florida's efforts in terms of supporting the operation and data analysis of the SuperCDMS Soudan experiment, performing detailed R&D into detector response to electron recoil backgrounds, both empirically and via simulation, and supporting the detector characterization and testing program for devices intended to be deployed in the proposed SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment at SNOLAB. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The SuperCDMS experiment has had a broad impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical development will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in cosmology, astronomy and industry.

Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are possible candidates. It is expected that the discovery and understanding of WIMP dark matter will require very large target masses. This award will support work on the MiniCLEAN detector, a single-phase detector designed to scale to large detector masses. MiniCLEAN follows the example of neutrino experiments where a monolithic target volume is surrounded by photomuliplier tubes, and the primary rejection of external backgrounds comes from the self-shielding made possible by the sheer size of the detector. This approach detects recoiling nuclei from WIMP interactions in liquid argon using only scintillation light. The simplicity of the single-phase technique allows for the construction of very large mass detectors at relatively low cost. The MiniCLEAN detector is presently under construction at SNOLAB. MIT has been involved in multiple aspects of the MiniCLEAN experiment, including the design and fabrication of muon veto system, the design and fabrication of the neutron calibration system, simulation and verification of the neutron background model, and preparation for data analysis. This award will support the MIT group's involvement in commissioning and operation of MiniCLEAN, and the subsequent data analysis.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The MiniCLEAN experiment will provide training for students and postdocs.

Using statistical photometric parallaxes, the collaboration will map the spatial distribution of halo stars at distances of 1.5 to 100 kiloparsecs from the sun. Their analysis of the full SDSS dataset will allow them to identify substructure, and determine the dynamics and chemical composition of stars in these tidal streams from spectral analysis. These studies will help to determine the number and sizes of merger events that occurred to form the halo of the Galaxy. The dynamics of the tidal streams will help understand the spatial distribution of dark matter in the Galaxy.<br/><br/>The results from this research will be distributed to the international research community through publications, delivered to undergraduate students through course lectures and disseminated to the general public through public lectures and press articles.

Observations indicate that 80% of the matter in the Universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary Dark Matter particles that do not emit or absorb light. Particle physics theories predict the existence of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with just the right properties to be this dark matter. If WIMPs are the dark matter, they may be detectable when they scatter in Earth-based detectors. To detect the low expected WIMP interaction rate, experiments must provide exquisite rejection of interactions from background radioactivity. For most experiments, radioactive contamination on the detector surfaces provides the dominant background. SuperCDMS work concentrates on removing these backgrounds through two methods. First, they will achieve better rejection of surface interactions by event reconstruction aided by detailed simulations of the detector response. Second, the group will reduce the amount of surface contamination, aided by the world's most sensitive detector of radioactive surface contamination, the BetaCage, being constructed with a group at Caltech. <br/><br/>Among the broader impacts, the technological development of phonon-mediated detectors has widespread applications in astronomy and physics. Operation and improvement of the BetaCage screener has broader impacts on other rare-event searches and even on the Si-chip industry. Its use for trace radioactive counting applications such as 14-C and tritium radioisotope dating has applications to other scientific fields, many with significant benefits to society. Furthermore, as part of the SuperCDMS collaboration, the group will develop and participate actively in the public outreach programs at the Soudan Mine, which hosts 60,000 visitors and tens of classes each year. Finally, the project will support the planning, development, and construction of a museum exhibit at Syracuse's Museum of Science and Technology that will introduce dark matter to the general public, increasing their understanding of modern science through their appreciation of the wonders of the Universe.|0

Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) that were produced moments after the Big Bang.

The funding will also partially support the group's continued work on superconducting sensor technologies for cryogenic detector applications. This work includes physics and technology-focused investigations of superconducting aluminum alloy sensors (potentially of interest for SuperCDMS and other experiments), as well as continued work with CDMS collaborators on feasible extensions of the current tungsten-based technology to larger substrates for SuperCDMS. The SCU group will continue to be responsible for using existing, fast turn-around, dilution-refrigerator facilities at Stanford University to provide the CDMS collaboration with rapid characterization of superconducting films. Evaluations of future sensor technologies based on both physics reach and promise for enhanced device fabrication yields will be ongoing throughout this two year funding period.<br/><br/>The SCU group includes the P.I. and typically two undergraduates. The group benefits tremendously from its strong ties to groups at nearby institutions, particularly Stanford and UC Berkeley. CDMS collaborators at these institutions generously provide the SCU group access to their extensive cryogenic and device fabrication facilities and their support has allowed the SCU group to perform a variety of physics experiments related to CDMS and beyond, that otherwise would have been cost-prohibitive for the SCU group alone.|0

The detectors will be operated at the DUSEL 7400 foot level within a cryogenic, shielded apparatus designed to provide a zero-background raw exposure of 4.5 ton year over 4 years. <br/><br/>The award, through a Cooperative Agreement, will fund the California Institute of Technology and collaborators to produce a Preliminary Design for such an experiment to be constructed and run at the DUSEL underground laboratory. The case is made that (1) recent technical innovations improvements are a moderate risk evolution from current performance and thus are largely an engineering effort appropriate to the DUSEL S4 solicitation; (2) prior efforts on CDMS and SuperCDMS provide empirically verified technical performance and cost baselines, placing these estimates on a solid foundation; and (3) the team undertaking this effort has a proven strong track record of such evolutionary gains in background reduction, background rejection, increased target mass, and scientific reach. Because of these characteristics, GEODM provides an extremely promising path to significant gains in WIMP sensitivity or to detailed study of a possible WIMP signal at DUSEL. Further, the CDMS collaboration has contributed many novel technologies now in use by other groups and in other fields. GEODM will address the cost challenges of cryogenic detectors, which will likely broaden even further their use (e.g., for homeland security).

The results from such measurements will enable the experiments to be placed at different levels according to their designed sensitivity and shielding requirements. Measuring muon-induced neutron flux at the 300-ft level will enable one to benchmark Monte Carlo simulation codes for all incoming experiments. Measuring and understanding high energy neutron excitation of the shielding and detector materials for neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments are crucial for interpreting results and establishing shielding requirements. On the other hand, measuring partial gamma-ray cross sections provides useful data for benchmarking Monte Carlo simulation.

These electron bubbles are drifted in an electric field to an array of Gas Electron Multipliers, where they are amplified and optically detected with commercial CCD cameras. <br/><br/>Education and Outreach have been a major emphasis of this R&D program since its inception.

However, nuclear recoils from fast neutrons in underground laboratories are one of the most challenging backgrounds to possible dark matter detection and the rate of this background is poorly quantified. Dark matter experiments rely on numerical Monte Carlo simulations to predict the background rate due to these neutrons, yet the simulation of these processes is uncertain because of the lack of appropriate data for direct comparison.<br/><br/>This award will enable the PI to measure the neutron content and multiplicity of the showers produced by high energy cosmic rays by joining forces with the Case/UCSB Multiplicity Meter for Benchmarking Cosmogenic Neutron Backgrounds. By locating the Case/UCSB Gd-loaded scintillator detector under the muon shield, this group can cross-correlate hadronic showers sampled by the large area coverage of the muon system with the smaller, but more detailed, neutron-sensitive information from the Multiplicity Meter. The data on neutron multiplicity would allow the underlying neutron production processes to be measured, also providing information about the parent high-energy neutron spectrum. Together, the rate, multiplicity and energy measurements will help to normalize the simulation codes and provide insight into deficiencies in modeling the underlying processes. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this work extend to the many other underground experiments that rely on knowing the neutron background environment. Being able to predict this background with greater reliability will serve the community well, and provide improved extrapolations for experiments aiming to operate in deeper sites at a future DUSEL. The technology used for the muon shield provides a training ground for a new generation of physicists with hands-on, short term projects.|0

These experiments seek to study the fundamental laws of physics, such as our understanding of how the sun shines, whether the neutrino is its own antiparticle, and what is the dark matter pervading the universe. However, to take full advantage of the shielding from cosmic rays, these experiments must be built from components with such low levels of radioactivity that even the best screening facilities available in shielded sites at the Earth's surface are insufficiently sensitive. New screening facilities must be built underground to allow these low-background experiments to succeed. <br/><br/>This proposal seeks resources to build a detector that would be the world's most sensitive screener of radioactive surface contamination such as low-energy-electron emitting radioisotopes. This detector, dubbed the ""BetaCage,"" will consist of an ultra-low-background multi-wire proportional chamber using neon gas at atmospheric pressure. This screener would have applications for rare-interaction physics experiments and trace radioactive counting applications. The BetaCage would detect electron rates low enough for the 150 kg stage of SuperCDMS to reach its design sensitivity for WIMP dark matter without being limited by misidentified low-energy electrons. <br/><br/>The BetaCage would also be ideal for screening alphas, with important applications for dark matter searches, solar neutrino experiments, and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, as well as for the Si-chip industry and for other scientific fields, many of general societal interest. Additional broader impacts will include the training of scientists in radiation-detection technologies and low-background techniques."|0

Noble gases are an attractive medium for particle detectors due to their low ionization potential, high scintillation efficiency, long electron lifetime and low cost. These detectors are currently employed to address a wide variety of fundamental physics questions, including neutrinoless double beta decay, neutrino oscillations, rare muon decays, dark matter searches and solar neutrinos. Many of these questions are central to the scientific mission of an underground lab and similar detectors have been proposed for the initial suite of experiments at DUSEL. <br/><br/>Most liquid detectors to date are of relatively modest size, with target masses ranging from a few kilograms to a few hundred kilograms. However, next-generation experiments are poised to push the boundaries far beyond the current state of the art. For an experiment to succeed in this new regime, it will be necessary to purify the cryogenic liquids far beyond what current technologies have achieved. For existing TPC-style detectors, the concentration of electronegative impurities must be less than about 100 ppt oxygen equivalent to avoid attenuation of the charge signal as it drifts through the detector volume. Therefore, the next set of experiments will require impurity concentrations from one to ten ppt, or free electron lifetimes from tens to hundreds of milliseconds. <br/><br/>This award will enable the group to develop a new method for detecting extremely low concentrations of impurities, with the potential to extend current sensitivities by several orders of magnitude. <br/><br/>As part of the Broader Impacts of this work, this impurity detector would find wide application for many of the fundamental physics experiments which are likely to be hosted by DUSEL. In addition, this work will also have significantly broader impact by serving to further the education of graduate students.|0

The Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) will explore new physics at extremely short distances not accessible to accelerator experiments. Specifically, the proposed proton stability experiments at DUSEL, along with a new generation of experiments at HyperK, MEMPHYS, ICARUS, and LENA, will either discover proton decay or at the very least put new limits on proton lifetimes which would be an order of magnitude or more better than the current limits. In view of the huge effort that will go into these experiments it is incumbent on theorists to delineate more clearly the prediction for the proton lifetime in various models, compute the branching ratios and provide criteria for discrimination among models that survive the SuperK limits. Current analyses on proton lifetime could be improved on two fronts. First, the detailed branching ratios for many models have not been worked out and, second, new effort is needed in reducing uncertainties in absolute prediction rates. <br/><br/>This award will provide funding for studies to fill in these gaps and provide the experimentalists with testable predictions of proton decay for a variety of unified models. They will investigate a new class of SO(10) models based on a unified Higgs sector for which proton decay has thus far not been calculated. <br/><br/>Among broader impacts, it is proposed to investigate the correlations between proton stability, neutrino masses, and dark matter consistent with WMAP data. These theoretical efforts are essential for the analysis and interpretation of data from the proposed new generation of proton stability experiments at DUSEL and elsewhere, and it is only with such effort that the maximum benefit from the proposed experiments can accrue.|0

Berkeley <br/>NSF PROGRAM: PHY - PARTICLE ASTROPHYSICS<br/>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Sadoulet, Bernard<br/><br/>TITLE: DUSEL Research and Development on subKelvin germanium for ton scale dark matter search<br/><br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Deciphering the nature of dark matter in the universe is one of the most urgent tasks in cosmology and particle physics today, and a successful program to detect Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) critically depends on the performance of the instrumentation available. This proposal requests support to enable improved future experiments for the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL). This effort is directed at improving the position resolution and rejection capability of the phonon-mediated plus ionization detector technology, which currently reaches the best WIMP sensitivity, and therefore is likely to open new scientific opportunities for a ton scale dark matter experiment. <br/><br/>The UC Berkeley group is a member of the SuperCDMS collaboration which will operate 25 kg of germanium sub-Kelvin detectors at the SNOLAB underground laboratory, aiming to reach a sensitivity approaching 10^(&#8722;45) cm^2 for spin independent cross sections and WIMP masses near 60 GeV. Such a sensitivity reach is scientifically very important and explores much of the same parameter space as the Large Hadron Collider for supersymmetric dark matter in the form of the lightest supersymmetric particle. <br/><br/>The DUSEL facility may be ready for experiments as early as 2012 or 2013 and it will be scientifically important to build at least one ton-scale dark matter experiment to improve further the sensitivity for WIMPs. It is natural to select the best one or two technologies around 2009-2010, most likely the sub-Kelvin and noble liquid strategies. For the sub-Kelvin technology, there is a need to improve background rejection and to develop mass production techniques to reduce costs and increase fabrication yields. In this three-year proposal, support is requested for one postdoctoral fellow and one undergraduate. This modest level of support will allow the group to fabricate and test several detector designs. <br/><br/>The CDMS team has been at the forefront of phonon-mediated and superconductor detector development, which already has broad impacts, in particular in the fields of Cosmic Microwave Background and of X-ray astrophysics. The proposed effort is likely to broaden this impact.|0

Observations indicate that 80% of the matter in the Universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary Dark Matter particles that do not emit or absorb light. The leading hypothesis for the nature of dark matter is that it consists of new elementary particles produced moments after the Big Bang, generally referred to as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. One way to detect them in an Earth-bound experiment is to measure the low energy nuclear recoils they produce in rare interactions with normal matter. This group will develop small NaI and liquid xenon detectors that can be installed in the Solar Neutrino Borexino detector, at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory, Italy, for a dark matter search. <br/><br/>The detector would be inserted through existing plumbing tubes into the center of the Borexino liquid scintillator. When positioned in the Borexino scintillator, the background in the small detector due to external sources of gamma rays and neutrons will be negligible. The Borexino scintillator also serves as a very efficient anti-coincidence detector to veto internal gamma and neutron backgrounds that originate and scatter within the small detector and in the Borexino scintillator. A 10-kg detector with the combination of low backgrounds from external and internal sources should have sufficient sensitivity to test the validity of the reported DAMA/LIBRA dark matter signal. <br/><br/>For Broader Impacts, this proposal addresses one of the major scientific questions of our time, the nature of dark matter in the universe. As a cross-disciplinary topic it also has an impact on advanced detector technology. The PI has a commitment to involving undergraduates in his research projects.|0

Support is requested to continue the successful program which has been in place since the MINOS detector was completed in 2003. The Soudan Underground Mine is a historical site operated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in an old iron mine in Northern Minnesota. Around 28,000 people per year take the ?historical? tour in the park, visiting the workings at the bottom of the ½-mile deep mine. The Laboratory is also on that lowest level of the mine, where experiments benefit from the 10**5 reduction in the cosmic ray background compared to the Earth?s surface. <br/><br/>This proposal is centered on the broader impact, but the outreach program described here has a significant impact on, and supports the intellectual merit of, the underlying science program. The coincidence of an established education and outreach program, a top-notch research facility, and an unusual and impressive location provide a great opportunity to bring students and the general public into the lab where they learn about the often esoteric world of particle physics in an intriguing and accessible fashion. They also propose to fund an annual Open House at Vermillion Community College in nearby Ely, MN. This will help give the lab a high and positive profile in the community as well as bring the science to even more people.|0

The NYU group continues to take a leading role in the implementation of the ATLAS detector's triggering system used to select collisions with large or imbalanced transverse momentum signatures. Through this program of effort, the NYU group proposes to continue its searches for new phenomena, to further develop statistical tools and techniques, and to maintain responsibility for the transverse energy trigger signatures. The group also aims to be a leader in a new analysis archival strategy and to continue R&D work on the tracker upgrade needed for the upgraded collider, the HL-LHC.<br/><br/>Analytically, the group will leverage the expertise gained from measurement of the top-antitop production cross section in the dilepton final state to search for the Higgs boson and exotic physics in the top sector. If a new particle is discovered in searches for the Higgs boson, the group plans to use its expertise in statistical techniques and the vector boson fusion production mode to measure the new particle's properties and confirm if it is indeed responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. NYU also plans to commission a new detector signature from highly collimated groups of leptons, a generic prediction from a class of models motivated by observations in dark matter searches. These analyses also provide the group with the depth and breadth of experience necessary to deal with surprises in the data.<br/><br/>Technically, for upgrade of ATLAS, NYU has developed an IR-laser system for study of prototype silicon strip detectors to be used in the ATLAS upgrade required for the HL-LHC. It plans to develop a modified system to allow rapid tests of detectors read out with digital chips being developed by ATLAS/CERN.<br/><br/>The NYU group is engaged in two distinct areas of broader impacts of their research effort. The first of these is the development a large exhibit on the LHC physics program for display at public events. The exhibit has been seen by thousands of people in diverse audiences in events in New York, Illinois, and California. The group proposes to extend this public outreach by further developing this exhibit, adding new interactive components and updated results. This will be done with the involvement of educators and students from the NYU Department of Teaching and Learning, who will help make this exhibit even more accessible to the K-12 population. The exhibit will be shown at science fairs and other venues.<br/><br/>For the second effort, the NYU group is actively involved in the important area of Data Preservation and Open Access. The statistical tools (under the name RECAST) that continue to be developed as part of this proposal have broader impacts within the physics community, and are gaining attention outside of physics as well. The question of how to archive data in high energy physics that allows future use (such as confronting new theories with preexisting data) is a daunting one, as the expertise and software required to do such analysis fade with time. The RECAST framework proposed by the NYU group represents a new approach to data management and access, which can address a crucial issue for the LHC and serve as a model for a broad range of scientific disciplines.|0

Csaba Csaki, Yuval Grossman, Toichiro Kinoshita, Peter Lepage, Liam McAllister and Maxim Perelstein at Cornell University. <br/><br/>The investigators propose to study some of the most important and exciting topics in a variety of fields within high-energy theory, including particle physics in and beyond the Standard Model, collider physics, string theory, and cosmology. Research on the Standard Model (SM) consists of investigations of flavor and neutrino physics, lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and precision quantum electrodynamics (QED). Beyond the Standard Model, explorations of diverse models of the TeV scale are proposed, together with studies of the new collider physics techniques necessary for testing them. Investigations of aspects of dark matter physics are also proposed. Within string theory the primary focus is on understanding the effective theories arising in string compactifications, and exploring the implications of string theory for cosmology. Intellectual merit: The Cornell particle theory group carries out state-of-the-art research in nearly every major area of modern particle theory. The unifying theme of the group's research program is a distinctive focus on theoretical problems that are relevant for present and future experiments, including the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the intensity frontier program, dark matter searches, and cosmic microwave background experiments. The proposed research is directed at maximizing the scientific impact of these experiments. The most important recent development in particle physics is the historic discovery of the Higgs(-like) boson, as part of the wealth of data produced by the 2010-2012 runs of the LHC. Professors Csaki, Grossman and Perelstein will focus their attention over the next five years on physics related to current and future colliders. Csaki will explore unconventional supersymmetric models that are still viable in light of the LHC data; alternative Higgs models, including a Higgslike dilaton and the composite Higgs; and other TeV-scale models consistent with LHC results. Grossman will explore the physics that is relevant to the intensity frontier program in the near and more distant future. This includes charm and beauty physics, charge-parity (CP) violation, and the study of neutrino physics. Perelstein's research plans include using the new window on TeV-scale physics provided by the 125 GeV boson to glean new information about possible physics beyond the Standard Model; understanding the implications of the direct LHC searches for new physics, focusing in particular on naturalness issues; and proposing new LHC searches motivated by both theoretical and experimental developments. In parallel, Perelstein proposes to continue to contribute to theoretical interpretations of dark matter searches, where several interesting hints of detection have already been reported, and much more data will soon become available. Professor Lepage, as a leading member of the ""High Precision QCD"" (HPQCD) lattice gauge theory collaboration, will continue the pursuit of high-precision results for heavy quark physics from lattice gauge theory, obtaining semileptonic D-meson form factors for charm physics; extending b-quark results to the same precision (of order 1%) as the charm observables; and determining the quark masses and the strong coupling constant to high precision. Professor Kinoshita has devoted the past decade to a systematic evaluation of the five-loop QED contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) of the electron. In the next few years, he proposes to improve the numerical evaluation of his group's analytic results. Professor McAllister plans to investigate the physics of the very early universe, using cosmological observations of ultraviolet-sensitive quantities to shed light on theories of quantum gravity. McAllister's primary focus will be understanding inflationary dynamics in compactifications of string theory, but he also proposes to study the vacuum structure of non-supersymmetric string compactifications. <br/><br/>Broader impact: The Cornell particle theory group puts a high priority on the training of graduate students and postdocs, as well as on the wide dissemination of recent research results to the general public. Over the past three years, the group graduated twelve students, a majority of whom are now postdocs, while eight of our former students who graduated over the past decade now have faculty positions in the U.S. or abroad. Every member of the group is vigorously pursuing all possibilities for outreach to the general public. Numerous public talks, articles, colloquia, high school lectures and teacher conferences have been produced in the past, and will continue to be organized in the future by the group members."|0

Results from neutrino oscillation experiments have provided compelling evidence that neutrinos have mass and give the first indication that the Standard Model of nuclear and particle physics is incomplete. With the realization that neutrinos are massive, there is an increased interest in investigating their intrinsic properties. Understanding the neutrino mass generation mechanism, the neutrino character (Majorana or Dirac), the absolute neutrino mass scale, and the neutrino mass spectrum are some of the main focuses of the immediate future's neutrino experiments. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this award is based on the fact that a sensitive search for the neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay is the only practical way to determine if neutrinos are Majorana particles (their own antiparticles). This exotic decay is the most sensitive test of lepton-number conservation, which is an important symmetry in elementary particle physics. With the goal of ultimately realizing a 1-tonne scale neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay experiment using Germanium (Ge) detectors, the Majorana collaboration is assembling a prototype referred to as the Demonstrator that is intended to confirm that background levels low enough to justify such a large experiment can be reached. The baseline plan for the Demonstrator is for 15 kg of Ge detectors fabricated from Ge enriched in the double-beta isotope 76-Ge. Because most of the cost of such an experiment is the apparatus associated with it and not enriched Ge, and because one can increase the mass of instrumented 76-Ge significantly without increasing that base cost, there is the opportunity to ""increase"" the physics reach of the project for a reasonable, incremental additional cost. This award provides support for extra Ge detectors fabricated from enriched material to improve the physics reach.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The technology of larger, lower-background HPGe arrays developed from a tonne-scale experiment can be expected to enable a new generation of highly efficient, ultra-low-background gamma spectroscopy measurements. Among the fields that stand to benefit from this new generation of technology are: direct dark matter searches; measurements for environmental monitoring; atmospheric, ocean, and groundwater environmental transport; methods of radioactive dating; reactor monitoring; bioassay for determining very low occupational exposures to radiation; and biological studies involving radiotracers at very low activities.

UNDERGROUND PHYSICS<br/>PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Sadoulet, Bernard<br/><br/>TITLE: Experimental Particle Cosmology<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>A broad range of observations, from galaxies and superclusters to distant supernovae and the cosmic microwave background radiation, tell us that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of ordinary particles, but exists in some dark form. Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs exist and are the dark matter, then their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector. <br/><br/>This proposal requests the renewal of the base program of the UC Berkeley group to support their participation in the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) CDMS-II & SuperCDMS 25 kg projects. This includes (a) the completion of the CDMS-II experiment, which is fully constructed and acquiring science data at the Soudan Mine in Minnesota, and (b) the testing and underground operation in the CDMS-II infrastructure at Soudan of two new SuperTowers. <br/><br/>This program will have broader impact than improving limits or detecting WIMPs. Not only are its scientific results important for astrophysics and particle physics, but its technological development will also push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors, whose applications are increasingly widespread, and contribute to the development of non-dissipative readout techniques. Furthermore, they continue to support the public outreach program at Soudan, which hosts some 60,000 visitors and tens of classes each year for tours of the mine and laboratory.|0

Deciphering the nature of this dark matter would be of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, high-energy particle physics, and our understanding of gravity. A leading hypothesis is that dark matter is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, an elementary particle beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, but predicted in various extensions, such as supersymmetry. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their local density in our region of the Milky Way potentially makes them detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector.<br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration, supported jointly by NSF and DOE, has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to distinguish the rare scattering of such WIMPs on nuclei from the prominent electron interactions from radioactivity. Using our powerful technology in the Soudan mine, with our high background rejection, CDMS is currently (July 05) the most sensitive WIMP search experiment in the world, by a factor of ten. <br/>The two years of funding provided by this award, will mainly support the operation of CDMS II at Soudan in order to extract the best science possible from the five towers of six detectors that we now have installed. Taking over from the CDMS II funding in January 2006, this NSF base funding will allow Berkeley to participate in the extension of CDMS running till June 2007 and in the analysis of the data collected. This should allow us to multiply our raw exposure by roughly a factor twenty and improve our current sensitivity by a factor ten. Berkeley's emphasis will remain the optimization of the detector performance and continuous performance monitoring, improvement of the electronic noise and further development of discrimination methods. The base funding will also support a modest effort of detector characterization in the laboratory, which will believe will become increasingly necessary to demonstrate the discrimination level reached in our analyses.<br/>We will also devote approximately 20% of the base funding to R&D for the future stages of CDMS. This second component is essential in maintaining the CDMS leadership worldwide and prepare for extrapolation to larger masses. The Berkeley effort will be divided between the development of the cold hardware for the detectors of the phase A of SuperCDMS (25kg total target mass), the test of phase A detector prototypes produced by Stanford and the study of kinetic inductance phonon sensing for the phase B or C of SuperCDMS (150 kg target mass or more).<br/>This proposal will partially support the research of three graduate students. Our education and outreach activity will focus on the improvement of the displays for the science tours at Soudan and on the apprenticeship program for East Bay High-School students. For the latter program, we have entered into collaboration with the SMASH summer academy, which supports academically high school students from underserved backgrounds. Based on last years pilot program involving one of their 9th Grade students in our laboratory, we are planning to have two student apprentices per year over the duration of this award.|0

The program covers activities in 9 major programs: ATLAS, MiniBooNE, D0, Pierre Auger, HiRes, Reactor Experiment, NuTeV, ZEUS, and eBubble. These research programs address six of the nine interrelated questions raised by the recent Quantum Universe report that lays out the path ahead for particle physics. <br/><br/>Despite the profound understanding of the fundamental laws and particles achieved in the last 30 years, there remain fundamental unanswered questions about our universe: What is the nature of the universe and its composition? What are matter, energy, space and time? How did we get here and where are we going? How do cosmic accelerators work? If there are new symmetries or physical laws, one must look beyond the Standard Model through precision measurements and at the energy frontier. This research program does that. Supersymmetry may be observed at the Tevatron with D0, and should be observed at the CERN LHC with ATLAS. The mystery of dark energy may be related to the Higgs field, which may be discovered at the LHC. If there are extra dimensions to space, they too may be accessible at the LHC. The research program will also address the question of the nature of fundamental particles, and through precision measurements probe higher energy scales: top quarks (D0, ATLAS), Bs mesons (D0), protons (ZEUS), neutrinos (BooNE, NuTeV, Reactor), and sparticles (ATLAS). Sparticles could yield candidates for dark matter. In the area of neutrino physics, there are many unanswered questions: How many neutrinos are there? Can we measure CP violation now that we know they have mass and oscillate? These are questions to be addressed by MiniBooNE and eventually a Reactor Experiment. As we look back to the early universe, accelerators will be used to understand the electroweak phase transition (ATLAS). <br/><br/>At the intersection of particle physics and astronomy, the HiRes and Auger experiments will study the very highest energy particles seen in the universe that are to this day poorly understood. What is the composition of these ultra high energy cosmic rays? What are their sources and how are they accelerated? <br/><br/>The Columbia University Nevis Labs groups plan to continue to build on their very successful programs in education and outreach. The goal is to engage the full educational spectrum from high school students, high school teachers, undergraduates and the general public in understanding and doing high energy physics. A primary emphasis of the Columbia programs is to target underrepresented groups to participate in these activities. Although progress has been achieved in increasing the representation of women in physics, much still remains to be done in increasing minority representation.

Work on two other future projects is also proposed: the new MicroBooNE and NuSOnG experiments. Particle physics considers a vast range of questions, from subatomic to cosmic scales. It is expected that new physics beyond the Standard Model will hold the key to making progress in our understanding. Some of the most important questions are: How do we explain the large disparity between the weak scale, the grand-unification scale and the Planck scale? What is the dark matter and dark energy in the universe? What is responsible for the large matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe; is it related to CP violation for the neutrinos? Why are the neutrino masses so small? <br/><br/>This award provides funds to support this group in the following research program: top quarks (D0, ATLAS), neutrinos (BooNE, Double Chooz), and sparticles (ATLAS). These last particles could yield candidates for dark matter. The neutrino sector has many unanswered questions: How many are there? Can we measure CP violation now that we know they have mass and oscillate? These are questions that are being answered by the MiniBooNE experiment and, in the future, by Double Chooz. In addition, precision neutrino experiments like NuSOnG will examine if the neutrinos have unexpected properties that give them a special place among the other particles. <br/><br/>The Columbia groups place a high priority on education and outreach and plan to build on their past very successful efforts by integrating a number of these activities into the ongoing research.

The symmetry between the electromagnetic and weak forces is observed to occur above the 100 GeV scale, but is broken at low energy. The Standard Model (SM) of fundamental interactions and constituents of matter posits the Higgs mechanism, resulting in an observable new particle (the Higgs boson), which induces the symmetry breaking, and gives mass to all observed quarks, leptons and gauge bosons. Though logically consistent, this mechanism is widely believed to be an incomplete and a probably flawed explanation. New phenomena are likely to exist which could point the way to further unification of forces and identify a candidate for the dark matter in the universe. New experimental data are essential to discover how Nature has chosen to extend the SM. These questions will be explored in two experimental programs, one at the ATLAS experiment at the CERN and the other being DØ research at the Fermilab Tevatron. <br/>The broader impact of the program touches several areas. The group will develop improved training programs for high school physics teachers, support the Mariachi Project that installs detectors to sense high energy cosmic ray showers in high school classrooms across the region, allowing students to collaborate through a computer grid in measuring their properties and to learn experimental skills, and to continue to give talks on physics research, accelerators and technological spinoffs to general audiences.|0

Accelerator based experiments, detectors in mines, and telescopes are all needed and used to explore fundamental questions such as the nature of dark matter. The Stanford group led by Principle Investigator Patricia Burchat will complete its investment in the highly productive BaBar experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and build a new effort in cosmology through the proposed Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. On the BaBar experiment the goal is to more than double the current data sample by the time the experiment completes its nine-year program at the end of FY2008. The Stanford group will contribute to the maintenance and operation of the SVT and the SVT radiation monitoring system. Members of the group will complete ongoing searches for new physics in rare or forbidden tau and charm decays, and a diverse set of analyses involving charmed baryons. The group is also initiating a new analysis effort involving D mixing and will conduct the final time-dependent Dalitz-plot analysis of B -> rho pi on the complete data sample, to extract the CKM angle alpha. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is the first ground-based telescope being designed from scratch to address the severe demands on systematic uncertainties needed to fully exploit weak gravitational lensing as a cosmological probe. The LSST will also address cosmological questions through studies of the growth of large scale structure, baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae. The Stanford group is joining the LSST project collaboration and will contribute to areas that benefit from the experience of particle physicists and aid in the understanding and reduction of potential systematic uncertainties: the development of a detailed simulation, the study of algorithms with existing data sets, and the design and construction of calibration systems. The broader impacts of the program have several foci. The PI will continue her efforts to integrate experimental particle physicists into the LSST project through tutorials and workshops. Members of the Stanford group have been very involved in programs that involve high school teachers and students (including those traditionally under-represented in physics) in basic research. The PI has led efforts to develop new undergraduate majors that increase the cohort of students who receive an education in physics.|0

By directly observing dark matter particles in our detectors, we will be able to determine the nature of the particles that make up to 83% of the mass of the universe. These studies will offer a unique window on physics beyond the Standard Model, and are complementary to searches for New Physics at the Large Hadron Collider. Direction-sensitive Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) detectors will provide the most convincing evidence for direct observation of dark matter due to their excellent background rejection capabilities. The correlation between the energy and length of the recoil track allows for a powerful rejection of backgrounds due to photons, electrons, and alpha particles. In addition, the correlation between the measured direction of the nuclear recoil and the expected direction of the dark matter wind allows for an efficient rejection of more insidious backgrounds, such as neutrons and solar neutrinos. Finally, directionality can discriminate between various dark matter halo models in our Galaxy, making directional detectors unique observatories for underground WIMP astronomy.<br/><br/>This award will provide funding to construct a detector that measures the direction of the WIMP particles as well as their recoil energy, to provide an unambiguous observation of dark matter, even in the presence of backgrounds. The detector proposed is DMTPCino, a 1 cubic meter, low-pressure time projection chamber (TPC) with optical readout. <br/><br/>The technology can be used for several applications outside particle physics, such as neutron detection for homeland security and defense applications, to scan for potentially hazardous materials through the emission of fission-spectrum neutrons. Applications of the DMTPC principle as an imaging device for medical and biological applications are also under study. The DMTPCino experiment is ideal for educating and training the next generation of particle physicists.|0

A particular focus of our work will be the study of stars in the far outer regions of these galaxies (e.g. stellar halos and outer thin/thick disks).Theory predicts many of the most important clues about galaxy formation should lie buried in these parts yet they have traditionally been overlooked in observational studies due to their extreme faintness and the large areas on the sky, which they subtend. Specific topics to be addressed include - the structure and content of outer galactic disks, the physical origin of disk truncations, the frequency and nature of stellar substructure and the ubiquity, structure and composition of stellar halos and thick disks.|0

Additional theoretical work will use hydrodynamic and N-body simulations to investigate the dependence on dark matter dynamics and on galaxy type, redshift, and cosmology.

Most high-z objects<br/>observed thus far are found to be rich in heavy elements, thus not qualifying as bona fide primeval<br/>galaxies. An alternative approach is to search among nearby galaxies that may be actively forming<br/>stars for the first time at the present epoch. The best candidates for such a search are extremely metalpoor blue compact dwarfs (BCDs). They constitute excellent laboratories for pursuing the following cosmological problems. The standard hot big bang model of nucleosynthesis (SBBN) is one of the key quantitative tests of big bang cosmology. The primordial abundance Yp of 4He, together with that of Deuterium, is crucial for checking the consistency of SBBN. The relative insensitivity of 4He production to the baryonic matter density means that Yp needs to be determined to a precision of better than 1%. Dr. Trinh Thuan, at the University of Virginia, will evaluate systematic effects and correct Yp for them to attain that precision. He will search for more extremely metal-deficient BCDs in the newly released Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectral data base to improve the determination of Yp. The study of the BCD stellar populations will allow them to understand the properties of massive stellar populations in very low metallicity environments, like those prevailing in the era of galaxy formation. Moreover, Cold Dark Matter models predict that low-mass dwarf galaxies could still be forming at the present epoch because they originate from density fluctuations considerably smaller than those giving rise to the giant ones. Thus establishing the existence of young dwarf galaxies in the local universe will put strong constraints on the primordial density fluctuation spectrum. Dr. Thuan will apply age-dating techniques which he has developed and refined to a sample of very metal-deficient BCDs. There is a dichotomy in the way star formation proceeds in BCDs. In some, star formation occurs in a ""passive"" low-level diffuse fashion, with a low extinction. In others, ""active"" star formation occurs at a high level in Super Star Clusters, mixed with dense gas and a large amount of dust. Dr. Thuan will study the physical parameters which<br/>govern that dichotomy. Dr. Thuan will also study how the metallicity of the neutral gas compare with that of the ionized gas. Is the metallicity of the H ii region higher because of self-enrichment? Which constraints can be put on the time scale for the mixing of newly formed heavy elements in the H ii region with the HI gas? If the metallicity of the HI gas is very low, that would put constraints on the amount of metal pre-enrichment by the hypothetical Population III stars during the early pregalactic epoch. Such studies will shed new light on the study of abundances in high-redshift damped Lyman-alpha systems. Finally, Dr. Thuan will use these models to study correlations of the efficiency of mass exchange between the galaxy and its environment with global properties of BCDs such as their sizes, luminosities, metallicities, star formation rates, etc. <br/>***"|0

Discovery of gamma-ray emission from super massive black holes in nearby galaxies has led to new understanding of the energetic processes occurring in these objects, and have also allowed study of infra-red radiation fields generated by galaxy formation in the early universe. The unknown origin of Galactic cosmic rays may be directly probed to their source through gamma ray emission at their source objects such supernova remnants. The nature of our three-dimensional space and time and the possible presence of additional dimensions may also be studied using VHE gamma rays. This research will support observational activities with VERITAS and Whipple, with an emphasis on these studying extragalactic infrared radiation fields, searching for the missing `dark matter' in our Galaxy, searching for evidence of extra dimensions associated with quantum gravity, and exploring new techniques for high-resolution observations of nuclear cosmic rays.<br/><br/>The University of Utah Gamma Ray Group will design and construct the calibration, Level 1 trigger, and Cables/Connectors systems for the VERITAS Observatory. The University of Utah plays a major role in the simulation and analysis efforts associated with the VERITAS and Whipple science goals. Utah will develop detailed simulations of Whipple and VERITAS detector response, and use these simulations to optimize observing strategies, electronic triggering configurations, and analysis procedures. The Utah gamma ray Group will also provide these simulations to the Whipple/VERITAS collaboration for use in scientific analysis of the VHE gamma ray observations. <br/><br/>The University of Utah Gamma Ray group will participate in Educational Outreach programs at the community, University, and State/National levels. This support will continue these existing activities and enhance them through development of the University of Utah as an educational outreach node associated with an Education/Public Outreach Initiative under development for VERITAS.|0

According to that theory, protons and neutrons, along with all other strongly interacting particles, are composed of even more fundamental particles called partons (quarks and gluons). Interactions between the partons are described by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The proposed research involves continued refinement in understanding the interplay between QCD theory and experiment, which is necessary to deepen the understanding of QCD and to determine the probability distributions of the partons in the proton by global analysis. The resulting CTEQ Parton Distributions are essential to the interpretation of experiments at the world's leading high energy collider facilities: Fermilab (Batavia, IL), DESY (Hamburg, Germany), RHIC (Brookhaven, NY), and CERN (Geneva, Switzerland). The Electroweak sector of the SM is extremely successful in explaining and predicting experimental data spanning a range in energy from the atomic scale to the Z boson mass.<br/>However, one major aspect of the model remains to be elucidated: the mechanism of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB), which generates masses for the W and Z bosons while leaving electromagnetic gauge symmetry intact. In the SM, EWSB is economically implemented through a single scalar particle called the Higgs boson. However, the SM cannot explain observations such as the hierarchical pattern of fermion masses, or the existence of dark matter; so it is widely believed that new measurements at very high energies, or very high precision, will soon turn up deviations from the SM that will point to new physics.<br/><br/>A second part of the project represents continuation of research to probe the EWSB mechanism in high energy collisions. Special consideration is given to measuring the couplings of the top quark to W and Z gauge bosons and to (elementary or composite) Higgs boson(s); and to searching for the Higgs boson and determining its properties. These are prime objectives of experiments at the Fermilab Tevatron collider and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are as follows: The achievement of the project will contribute to understanding of the fundamental interactions in Nature. The project trains graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in theoretical high energy physics at MSU and at the CTEQ summer schools. It also provides opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in research through the REU program, and for high school teachers and middle school students to experience forefront research through Summer programs sponsored by MSU and the State of Michigan.|0

Three aspects will be studied: First, a new 3.5 meter telescope with remote observing capabilities will be used to monitor the brightness of images in candidate and known lenses. The light curves will be used to measure the value of the Hubble constant, test the lens hypothesis for controversial systems, and detect microlensing events, which have implications about the nature of dark matter and the very small scale structure of quasars. Second, observations of new candidate lenses to be identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data sets will enable the assembly of a large (several hundred) well controlled statistical sample, thus allowing measures of fundamental cosmological parameters. Third, advanced cosmic simulation and numerical lensing codes will be employed to predict the lensing consequences of various scenarios for the formation and evolution of galaxies and large scale structure.

Studies have shown that the Lyman-alpha forest is the observational signature of an extended ionized gas arranged in the shape of filaments and sheets, known as the cosmic web, from which galaxies condense. Thus, observations of Lyman-alpha absorption probe not only the ionization history and baryon density of the Universe, but also the dark matter variations that lead to the formation of structure. This project will a) determine the intensity and source of the radiation responsible for ionizing the intergalactic gas, b) use high resolution spectra to investigate inter-galactic clouds at the end of the reionization era, c) find more of a special class of absorbers produced in galactic outflows, and d) determine the heavy element composition of the most tenuous regions of intergalactic space. The work unites observations of the large-scale distribution of matter with numerical simulations carried out by theorists. There is sufficient large telescope access to obtain those data not already in hand.<br/><br/>This Principal Investigator collaborates with scientists in Great Britain, Japan, Holland and Australia, and his collected data are used by colleagues across the US as well as in Poland, Russia, Holland and Great Britain. These data are also used in other fields of science, notably to investigate the composition of the earth's atmosphere and its seasonal and long-term changes. This work thus has a widespread impact in addition to its influence through publications and the associated student training."|0

Their detection on earth can be carried out with the use of underwater/ice Cherenkov detectors. Fundamental information on active galactic nuclei, gamma ray bursts as well as on dark matter can be extracted from the study of these neutrinos. The AMANDA neutrino telescope is the most sensitive high energy neutrino observatory operative. It is composed by strings of photomultipliers (PMTs) placed deep in the ice of the South Pole. PMTs, encapsulated in glass spheres, collect the Cherenkov light produced by neutrino induced muon or cosmic ray muons. The future of the experiment, named Ice Cube, will have an effective area of one square kilometer.With the current technique, a significant amount of Cherenkov photons are lost owing to the optical properties of the PMT encapsulating glass. The development of a system capable to maximize the collection of the light is the object of the project here proposed. This can be obtained through the selection of a suitable wave length shifter (WLS) and through its integration with the encapsulated PMT. Via Monte Carlo simulations we propose also to study the impact of the hardware development on critical detector parameters like effective area, angular and energy resolution etc. and, more general, to estimate the improved sensitivity of Ice Cube to neutrino detection.|0

In 2012 the LHC has led to the discovery of the Higgs boson, the only particle in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics that had not been observed previously. After this final triumph of the SM, the primary mission of the LHC will be to look for new physics beyond the SM. The existence of such new physics within the reach of the LHC is motivated by several observations which cannot be explained within the SM, but which point to the distance scales that are being explored at the LHC. The existence of Dark Matter (DM) in the universe with the correct properties is an example of this. In light of the fact that no clear signs of such new physics have been observed so far, the possibility needs to be considered that the new particles in question may be difficult to discover, either because they are rarely produced, or because their experimental signatures can be easily mistaken for those of known particles present in the SM. The results of the LHC searches for new physics will define the path of high energy physics in the future, which makes it essential that all efforts be made to maximize the discovery potential. Professor Kilic's research project will address how further optimization for discovery and higher precision for measurements can be obtained in the challenging scenarios mentioned above. <br/><br/>There are also several broader impacts of the research described in this project. A significant portion of the research will be conducted by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, which will allow them to develop critical research skills in pursuing an academic career path. In order to make it possible for young people to appreciate the excitement associated with particle physics, Professor Kilic will also give lectures about aspects of modern physics at local high schools including the Liberal Arts and Science Academy (LASA) and Travis High School. At a more formal level, Professor Kilic also teaches a class on the SM and on beyond-the-SM physics at the University of Texas at Austin at the postgraduate level, the curriculum of which will be modified in light of future discoveries made at the LHC.|0

Shape restricted regression and smoothing splines offer one promising approach to the problem, and the combination of shape restrictions with local polynomial methods another. In large samples the emphasis is on asymptotic distributions. With a lot of smoothing the contribution of the shape restrictions to the asymptotic distribution is negligible; with only a little smoothing, the shape restrictions dominate, leading to non-normal asymptotic distributions. The nature of the transition between a little smoothing a lot is investigated. In many cases, especially with smoothing splines, an estimator is the solution to a differential equation. In such cases it is possible to use the Green's function to construct an asymptotically equivalent kernel estimator from which the asymptotic distribution may be found. In moderate samples, the shape restrictions do affect the distribution of estimators, even in the presence of substantial smoothing. The size of this effect is investigated both analytically, using techniques of shrinkage estimation, and by simulation. Problems with known inequalities for parameters also arise in models with only a few parameters, like variance components, and classical confidence intervals can be empty, or degenerate, in such problems. In current work interest centers on finding Bayesian credible intervals with good frequentist properties.<br/><br/> The work on shape restricted density estimation and regression is motivated by a project to map the distribution of dark matter in nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies, like Ursa Minor. Dark matter is matter that cannot be seen. Its existence is inferred from gravitational effects, but what it is comprised of is an open question. It is expected that knowing where the dark matter is may shed some light on what it is. The work on models with few parameters is motivated by the problem of disentangling signal and background events in both physics and astronomy. The confidence interval problem is an important part of the search for an elementary particle, the Higgs, in particular, and has been a featured topic at several recent meetings of high-energy physicists. The investigator is using these two examples and others in an interdisciplinary seminar on Statistics in the physical sciences.|0

It will concentrate on the physics responsible for the masses of many of these particles. This is the principal unsolved mystery in the standard model of the basic forces. The research will also deepen our understanding of quantum field theory, which provides the most useful mathematical language for the study of this physics. This language is important in other fields (condensed matter physics, for example) as well as in particle physics. This project also will focus on aspects of string theory. Specific areas of inquiry in string theory will include quantum gravity, aspects of strings propagating in a space (in particular, the study of strings in the context of cosmology and black holes), and topological field theories. String theory has been perhaps the most active area of research in high energy physics in the past seven years. Research in string theory is very important since string theory is the only known fundamental theory which reconciles quantum theory with Einstein's theory of gravity. This project will play an important role in the advancement of this subject by studying, classifying and unifying various solutions to string theory. Finally, the project will investigate the relations of elementary particles to objects and processes that cannot be directly studied at accelerators, such as the dark matter in the universe, black holes produced by gravitational collapse, grand unified theories and baryon number production in the early history of the universe.|0

Recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have corroborated the basic picture of inflationary cosmology, which gives an approximate prediction of a spatially flat universe with scale invariant density perturbations on the largest length scales. If the inflationary paradigm is correct, the CMB provides a handle onto the earliest history of the universe. The PI plans to investigate the nonadiabatic interplay between curvature and isocurvature perturbations arising from particle production during inflation, derive signatures of superheavy dark matter (and other nonthermal scenarios), and search for novel consistency conditions for inflationary scenarios. These investigations will not only provide new ways to interpret existing and future CMB and structure formation data, they will allow constraints on conjectures of physics beyond the Standard Model. Another set of proposed research activities focus on understanding the cosmological implications of the anticipated discovery of Higgs and other new TeV scale physics at the LHC. In this context, one important handle for cosmology is the potential generation of the baryon asymmetry at the electroweak phase transition. Because electroweak baryogenesis is a complicated phenomenon, a prediction of the baryon asymmetry accurate to an order of magnitude still requires refinements. The final set of proposed research actvities are centered on the idea of alternate theories of gravity, which have a multitude of implications for cosmology. One avenue for further exploration is in the context of extra dimensions, and the other is in the context of modifications of fourdimensional Einstein-Hilbert action (particularly in the infrared). The PI plans to explore quantum as well as classical field theoretic aspects of the fields coupled to the alternate gravity.|0

Part of the planned project focuses on theoretical models that can simultaneously explain the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking and the nature of dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles. Different models and their potential experimental signatures will be compared, in order to develop model-independent analysis techniques. The proposed research work, while theoretical in nature, will be directly beneficial for the experimental LHC collaborations. The other part of the project focuses on effective field theory applications for heavy quark, collider, and gravitational physics. In particular developing an effective field theory for calculating low-x physics and the use of an effective field theory for gravity to investigate questions of interest to LIGO and LISA. The broader implications of this proposal are that this project examines several fundamental issues including questions of direct phenomenological relevance to present and future generations of particle accelerators.

Until recently, experiments have been done at US facilities such as Fermilab, SLAC, and Cornell CESR. These large labs often had in-house theoretical physics groups that could aid in the planning and analysis of the experiments. However next year, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will start operation, making obsolete all current US Collider laboratories. At this facility two large experiments, ATLAS and CMS will be supported approximately 30% by DOE and NSF and will have large participation by people previously working at the US facilities such as Fermilab, SLAC, and CESR. <br/>In order for the discovery capabilities of the LHC to be fully utilized many calculations and calculational tools need to be developed so that the theoretical uncertainties related to the standard model of strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions become less than the experimental uncertainties. Event generators used by experimentalists in analyzing data need to be generalized or totally rewritten so that signatures coming from candidate theories for explaining Beyond the Standard Model Physics can be understood and to compared with data. Finally, Non-standard Model ideas that include Supersymmetry, Extra Dimensions, Grand Unified Theories, Brane-world Scenarios, and String inspired Effective theories will need to be systematized and analyzed so that their predictions can be easily compared with the new data from the LHC including experimental cuts, backgrounds etc. The LHC is an essential discovery tool for finding new phenomena which go beyond the Standard Model and which already have been hinted at by the discovery of dark matter, dark energy and small masses for the neutrinos. The US effort in those areas of physics crucial to interpreting and making best use of the LHC facility needs revitalization. The US effort will have to be University based and is an excellent arena for training students and the next generation of Phenomenoligists. The purpose of the LHC initiative is to have a mentoring process for involving US graduate students and Post-Docs to get involved with calculations relevant for the interpretation and analysis of upcoming experiments. <br/>The initiative calls for one-year fellowships for graduate students and two-year fellowships for Post-docs to work under the guidance of a mentor on LHC related theory projects. The students, Post-Docs and Mentors will form a network with communication by teleconferencing. There will be two annual meetings with experimentalists to discuss the ongoing data collection process and its interpretation. It is hoped that the synergy between the young theorists and the experimental community will present a new paradigm for optimal discovery potential in the field of High Energy Physics. It is also hoped that this initiative will allow the US to again take a leadership role in High Energy Phenomenology. The network formed will provide a backbone for a nationwide collaborative theory network making it possible for physicists from isolated groups and smaller institutions to participate and focus their efforts on projects that are directly relevant to the LHC.|0

A broad range of observations indicate that 80 to 90% of the matter in the universe is in some new form of matter. The resulting Standard Cosmology holds that a quarter of the energy density of the universe is a new fundamental form of matter not yet encountered in the laboratory, and most of the remainder is dark energy. The solution to this mystery may lie in the existence of some new generic class of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, whose existence is also motivated by physics beyond the standard model of particle interactions. WIMP detection experiments require operation deep underground to prevent cosmic ray interactions from causing false positive signals. <br/> The LUX and ZEPLIN collaborations, building on their pioneering efforts in liquid xenon (LXe) dark matter detectors and their broad expertise in low background techniques and rare event searches, propose here a plan for the design of a 20-ton LXe detector (LZ20). The LZ20 detector will use established two-phase LXe technology with readout of primary and secondary scintillation signals for particle identification together with 3d position reconstruction to exploit the self-shielding of the LXe, removal of surface artifacts and calibration of position dependent response functions. This detector, installed at the 4850 level, with a fiducial mass of 13.5 tons and an initial operating period of 1000 days, will suppress internal and external backgrounds from electromagnetic and neutron interactions to below a single event and achieve a sensitivity to WIMP-interactions down to cross section of 10 to the power negative 48 cm2. At this exposure, the sensitivity will begin to encounter irreducible backgrounds from solar and atmospheric neutrino interactions this experiment therefore represents the definitive WIMP search that can be performed with liquid Xe.<br/><br/>Regarding Broader Impacts Dark Matter science is broadly appealing to the public, building on the natural curiosity of the public as well as the connection and familiarity with gravity. The collaboration proposes to develop a range of activities, from tours and displays to partnerships with local schools and individuals, to foster an interest in science and science careers. Dark matter experiments demand the development of new technologies that are ultra-sensitive to radiation, and new methods for achieving ultra-low radioactive backgrounds. There is an overlap of these technologies and methods with those used in a wide range of nuclear security contexts. Through direct technology development or through the training of personnel that transfer to industry or defense labs later in their careers, the collaboration expects significant impact from LZ20 particularly because of the involvement of LLNL.

However, there are reasons to believe that a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) represents more accurate description of electro-weak and strong interactions and elementary particles that participate in them. GUT does not only address some of the conceptual problems of the SM such as anomaly cancellation but it offers possibility to explain various parameters of the SM such as the masses and mixings of elementary particles. And, it can incorporate mechanisms that explain the observed baryonic asymmetry of the universe and the nature of dark matter. Besides a few exceptions, realistic GUT models require a large number of assumptions to be predictive. And, these assumptions often enough outnumber predictions/postdictions.Prime example of the theory that invokes no additional assumptions and that is promising in terms of its testability is the ""minimal unified SO(10 )"" theory (MUST). This theory is super-symmetric and renormalizable with only the 10, 126, anti-126 and 210 representations in the Higgs sector. Due to its appeal and relative simplicity it has been focus of study of various groups. These groups addressed two separate issues. Namely, some of them addressed numerical fitting of fermion masses and mixings while other groups concentrated purely on studies of the viability of Higgs sector and corresponding symmetry breaking patterns. However, there exists no complete self-consistent study that addresses both issues simultaneously. Since there appears to be the tension between the two the proof of model's viability demands unified approach. Thus, the main objective of the project is to achieve first ever-self consistent analysis of this theory in order to conclusively establish whether it is realistic or not."|0

Chief among these are LHC-related research along with model building and research related to Dark Matter. Many models Randall discusses are designed to address the hierarchy problem. The hierarchy problem remains one of the outstanding motivations for believing that interesting Beyond-the-Standard Model physics should exist at the weak scale. The question of why there is such a large separation between the Planck scale and the weak scale, or even how a theory incorporating quantum mechanics and special relativity can consistently maintain two such very different mass scales without a highly unlikely fine-tuning remains the major theoretical issue today for weak scale particle physics. Warped extra-dimensional geometry can potentially resolve the hierarchy problem. In this scenario, the cut-off varies over an extra dimension so that although the cut-off of a five dimensional theory is of order of the Planck scale, the local cut-off on a brane (which we will call the TeV brane) is of order a TeV. Randall is also guided by connections to general relativity solutions, string theory, and cosmology. Some work will be devoted to particular models, such as Randall-Sundrum (RS) warped geometry and its experimental signatures, supersymmetry and search strategy and model building, Higgs physics, and flavor physics. In addition Randall and colleagues will consider other models for comparison and consider potentially interesting signatures. With dark matter they will investigate new classes of models and consider possible implications for the various experiments of different types of models. In addition Randall plans to engage in more theoretical work related to general relativity and cosmological solutions. <br/><br/>The project also has many broader impacts. With the onset of the LHC there are many opportunities to explain particle physics and science in general to the interested public. The activities in which Randall is and will be involved include numerous public lectures and interdisciplinary conference talks, magazine and newspaper articles, including pieces Randall has written and articles Randall was interviewed for as well as appearances on TV, radio, and in documentaries.|0

It is now possible for literally trillions of objects to be followed in a computer as they are influenced by varying environmental conditions (gravity, pressure, density, temperature as well as the presence of dust, gas, strong magnetic fields, and even dark matter). These simulations show us how stars, planets, and galaxies may have formed, evolved, and died either quietly or in a violent explosion such as a Super Nova. These computer simulations are valuable tools for scientists and they also enable the computer programmers to produce ""visualizations"" (essentially movies, in 2- or 3-D) of these same phenomenon that are now widely used to show complex interactions on a computer monitor or projector screen to be enjoyed by all. Highly popular computer games and science fiction movies have driven the digital electronics industry to create ""graphics processing units"" that can very rapidly and efficiently manipulate digital pictures. Such GPUs are now common in smart phones, game consoles, and personal computers. On a much larger scale, scientists are now using GPUs in addition to the more traditional Central Processing Units (CPUs) of early computer days, to make large parallel processing machines (with hundreds of GPUs and CPUs) of very high power and speed to perform these complex calculations and manipulations. Dr. Brant Robertson of the University of Arizona is leading a team who will put together such a computer cluster to answer questions in theoretical astrophysics.

The FTK will perform global track recognition reconstruction using the innovative technique of massive parallelism. A billion track patterns are pre-stored in custom content-addressable memory (Associative Memory) chips that are being designed. As each hit leaves the detector at full speed, it is simultaneously seen by all patterns. Track fitting is replaced by a linear calculation of the track parameters and the goodness of fit, with nearly offline resolution. With modern electronics, one can fit tracks at a rate of one track per nanosecond. <br/><br/>For the next decade, experiments at the LHC will provide unprecedented opportunities for answering the most important questions in elementary particle physics. Data collected by ATLAS will be used for hundreds of simultaneous analyses to search for the Higgs boson, supersymmetry, large extra dimensions, dark matter, Hidden Valley particles, the carriers of new forces, and other possible new phenomena as well as measure the detailed properties of the top and bottom quarks and the W and Z bosons in an attempt to understand what is beyond the Standard Model. Important discoveries are likely, but determining what the new phenomena are will not be easy. Large numbers of signal events are needed for such measurements, with as little background as possible. Tracking is essential for selecting events containing heavy fermions. At such luminosity, where large occupancy in the tracking detectors greatly increases track reconstruction time, only a small fraction of the events selected by the level-1 trigger could have track reconstruction done. The FTK, on the other hand, does global tracking three orders of magnitude more quickly than software reconstruction. As a result, it will enhance the physics reach for a broad range of ATLAS studies increasing the number of events retained for offline analysis by a factor of ten or more for broad classes of possible new phenomena. This means that if the new physics is dominated by such processes, ATLAS will be able to collect as many signal events in a year with much improved signal-to-background as it would without the FTK in a decade at the same luminosity. <br/><br/>This system is not only crucial for the ATLAS experiment, advancing the physics program of over 3000 scientists world-wide with 600 in the U.S., including over 200 graduate students from 40 institutions, but will also promote innovations in detector technology. The university groups in this proposal have a tradition for involving undergraduate and graduate students in detector development projects and this project will bring unique opportunities for training and teaching modern electronics and computing to a variety of levels of young people. It will be one of the most sophisticated systems built in high energy physics. Under the supervision of professors and engineers, graduate students and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, will collaborate in designing, building, and testing electronic boards, writing the firmware and software, and comparing to simulation - all marketable skills. Two of the five PIs are female thereby promoting diversity. This extremely fast pattern recognition technology that would be developed for the FTK could have a profound impact on all future versions of collider and astrophysics experiments as well as applications to other field such as medical imaging. As an example, in proton computed tomography the pattern recognition technology has the potential to increase data acquisition rates and thus reduce imaging time with improved resolution.|0

The observatory consists of a three dimensional array of photosensors buried deep in the Antarctic ice cap, with 59 of the planned 86 strings of sensors now deployed and operational. We are using data collected by IceCube to search for ultrahigh energy tau neutrinos. Tau neutrinos are produced when electron and muon neutrinos from astrophysical sources oscillate as they travel to us, but unlike electron and muon neutrinos, tau neutrinos are not produced in significant numbers in cosmic ray air showers in the Earth's atmosphere. Tau neutrinos are thus essentially guaranteed to come from astrophysical sources, and observing even a few tau neutrinos would tell us a great deal about astrophysical accelerators of cosmic rays and neutrinos. We have led the design effort for the new DeepCore extension to IceCube, which will be completely deployed at the South Pole in early 2010. Using IceCube and DeepCore, we will observe neutrino oscillations at higher energies than ever before, measure the spectrum of atmospheric electron neutrinos, search for sources of neutrinos in the Galactic plane, and search for dark matter in the Sun's gravitational well. <br/><br/>Students and postdoctoral scholars working on this project receive strong scientific and educational preparation in the techniques of particle astrophysics, high energy physics, and the mining of large data sets. Our graduate and undergraduate students work closely with scientists around the world, fostering international scientific collaboration. Undergraduate students conducting research with us have received awards such as Goldwater Scholarships and are enrolled in graduate programs at institutions such as UC Berkeley.

This project is aimed at advancing the theoretical understanding of such aspects of physics beyond the standard model and at maximizing the amount of information that can be obtained from the experimental data by considering new analysis frameworks and exploring new connections between different phenomena. A significant effort in high energy physics is dedicated to extending the evidence for neutrino oscillations that has accumulated over the past decade. As part of this effort, the PI plans to work on optimizing the next generation of neutrino experiments and developing a better framework for understanding the experimental data and its implications for theoretical models. <br/><br/>Theoretical model building is addressed by emphasizing connections between implications for different observables in neutrino physics, collider physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Correctly interpreting available data and testing the underlying physics is extremely important and will be addressed in the project in the context of the MiniBooNE experiment. The project also proposes novel uses of already existing data as well as of data from upcoming experiments. In particular, the plans discuss how the Ice Cube Deep Core array, which will observe neutrinos from the galactic center region and neutrinos from dark matter annihilation, can also be used for detailed studies of atmospheric neutrino oscillations. <br/><br/>Another research direction discusses high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources. The observation of such neutrinos could have profound implications for both high-energy physics and astrophysics. An exploration of possible high-energy neutrino signals and their interpretation is proposed, emphasizing the importance of flavor composition of the neutrino fluxes.<br/><br/>The broader impacts are as follows: High energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology and the questions they are trying to address are very exciting and capture the interest of a larger public, providing excellent outreach opportunities.

The same experiment would lead to an improved sensitivity to a finite neutrino magnetic moment. Many exciting opportunities for such a coherent neutrino detector technology exist, both in fundamental and applied Physics. Searches would also be possible for several types of Weakly Interacting Massive Particle dark matter candidates presently beyond the reach of any existing detector. Finally, the design performs ideally within the context of next-generation double beta decay searches using enriched Ge diodes (MAJORANA, GERDA), by accomplishing an efficient background rejection within a single-channel device, avoiding the complications and risks involved in using multi-channel segmented detectors.<br/><br/>Support is requested for a multi-year R&D program to further characterize the fabrication technique of this novel type of radiation detector, by building an additional six diodes, the intent being to develop the best possible design option for MAJORANA.

In order to answer (some of) these questions from a theoretical standpoint several models have been proposed. Among these the most thoroughly analyzed are the ""standard model"" and ""supersymmetry"". A very intriguing possibility is that the symmetry between electromagnetic and weak interactions is broken dynamically by a new kind of strong force, known as ""technicolor"" (TC). Although very appealing, TC has received less attention than competing theories, because its strong nature makes it more difficult to analyze. However in the past few years a lot of progress has been made to understand strong dynamics, and we are in a position to make specific predictions about the signatures of TC at colliders.

Neutrinos are the most prolific particles in the universe, and only since 1998 has it been established that they have any mass at all. It has now been well established experimentally, that in traversing from the sun to earth, and those created in our upper atmosphere, do change from one type to another, which requires that they do have mass. Determining their mass may also determine if they could account for part of the dark matter (sometimes called the missing mass of the universe). These experiments called neutrino oscillation experiments; however, cannot tell us how much mass they possess, just that their masses are not zero. There are two methods to directly determine the masses of neutrinos. <br/>In the first method, a precision measurement is made of the energy spectra of beta particles from radioactive decay of light nuclei. The deviation from the canonical theoretical shape of the energy spectrum near the high-energy end is a measure of the mass of the electron-type neutrino. These experiments are very difficult and are somewhat limited in mass sensitivity. Nevertheless, within their range of sensitivity, they are very valuable.<br/>In the case that neutrinos are their own anti-particles, there is an exotic radioactive decay called neutrinoless double-beta decay, that would be far more sensitive to neutrino mass. In addition, establishing by direct observation that this process exists, would prove that neutrinos are their own anti-particles. This in itself is extremely important for completing the theory of elementary particles. It would also support specific models of the very early universe that explain why the universe is almost completely particles at present, with almost no anti-particles. Without some small excess of particles over anti-particles in the very early universe, we ourselves, and all we see, could not exist today. <br/>The projects CUORE and Majorana are both large, next generation neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. They are being designed to probe a mass range a factor of ten more sensitive than presently exists from three experiments, two of which the PI of this grant participated in with leadership roles. The Majorana experiment is a proposed 500 kg array of high purity Ge detectors, isotopically enriched in 76Ge, the candidate parent double beta decay nucleus. It involves five national laboratories and eight universities. It would be built in the US with US technology. I involves many graduate students and will be a prolific source of PhD thesis material. There are a number of spin-off technologies useful in nuclear weapon non-proliferation and in homeland defense.<br/>CUORE is a proposed 750 kg array of cryogenic detectors of tellurium oxide to search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of the isotope 130Te. It is a collaboration between Italy and the US, and is being constructed in the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Assergi, Italy. It is a new technology because of its mass. It offers the same kind of educational opportunities as does Majorana, and is training US graduate students and post doctoral scientists in the technology of very large cryogenic detectors that do not exist in the US.|0

The interrelated physics of neutrinos and strong interaction physics/nuclei is at the heart of current theories for the origin of the light nuclei and the baryon/lepton numbers in the early universe, the origin of the heavy nuclei in stellar collapse-based events, the dynamics of supernovae, and potentially even the dark matter/energy problems. Nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics stand at the contact point of two great current trends in science: (1) the ongoing experimentally driven revolution in neutrino physics; and (2) the startling recent advances in the capabilities of observational astronomy, especially in cosmology. This represents a tremendous opportunity for advancing both fundamental neutrino/nuclear physics and astrophysics and cosmology through their interconnection. The work supported by this project will aim at exploiting this opportunity. In fact, the PI and his graduate students over the last three funding cycles have discovered a number of these connections between fundamental weak interaction/neutrino/nuclear physics and the frontiers of astrophysics, in early universe physics, the physics of gravitational collapse, nucleosynthesis, and especially the possible connections between neutrino ?avor transformation and dynamics/nucleosynthesis. This has proven to be an excellent training ground for graduate students (7 PhD's in 9 years, all of whom have positions in nuclear physics research, and 5 have tenured or tenure track positions) and undergraduates (6 REU undergraduates). This project will enable the continuing training of excellent students. Coupled with the PI's seminars/outreach and publications, this constitutes the broader impact of this project beyond the scientific product. Arguably, the mass-squared differences and vacuum mixing angles (save for 13) of the neutrinos are now measured. A key goal of this project is to assess and calculate the impact of this new knowledge on models for the physics of the early universe, gravitational collapse, and nucleosynthesis. Some neutrino properties, like the CP-violating phase(es) and 13 remain unmeasured. A goal here will be to assess the role of these quantities in astrophysical environments with an eye toward constraints. Ultimately, the full extent of the neutrino mass and mixing spectrum, especially regarding right-handed states remains mysterious. Because the cosmological parameters (e.g., as derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotopies) and neutrino properties are so tightly constrained, a positive result in the on-going mini-BooNE experiment, for example, could signal the existence of a light SU(2) singlet 'sterile' neutrino which mixes with active species. This might also signal the existence of a large net lepton number(s) as well as call for a radical overhall of existing models for stellar collapse, heavy element nucleosynthesis, the role of neutrinos in dark matter/energy, and the origin of the baryon number. Observations of Ultra Metal Poor halo stars recently have given us new insight into the r-process which challenge existing models (e.g., the solar system abundance pattern seems to be universal for nuclear masses > 100). <br/>The PI and his students will direct analytic and numerical calculations toward: (1) an understanding of active-active and active-sterile channel neutrino flavor transformation in the early universe as regards big bang nucleosynthesis and lepton number generation/destruction/limits, CMB derived neutrino mass limits, supernova shock re-heating, r-process nucleosynthesis, the supernova neutrino signal, and all with emphasis on insight into the newly discovered fixed point solution for the nonlinear neutrino-neutrino forward scattering 'background' potential in the active-active neutrino/antimeutrino conversion channel; (2) a further study of neutrino-nucleus interactions in stellar collapse/heavy element nucleosynthesis, including de-excitation of hot nuclei into neutrino pairs and neutrino capture-induced fission, as well as a consistent treatment of the relationship between the high temperature nuclear partition function and the weak strength distribution in nuclei; (3) studies directed toward better constraints on sterile neutrino dark matter from better knowledge of the physics of the QCD epoch in the early universe, from future x-ray observatories, and from the effects of these particles in post-supernova explosion neutron stars, especially the way in which the neutrino potentials which the govern de-coherence production of these heavy states evolve with time; (4) exploring the role of dynamical neutrino mass generation in cosmology; (5) studies of high neutron excess r-process nucleosynthesis with fission cycling.|0

The motions of stars and gas in both the ring and the central galaxy are controlled by gravitational forces, including those of the `dark halo' of non-luminous matter. If the dark halo is roughly spherical, gas in the ring should orbit in circles around the galaxy center, while if the dark stuff lies in a Milky-Way-like disk, the ring will be squashed into an oval by its gravitational force. From observations these motions, the investigators will determine whether the halo is roughly round, or forms a flattened disk. The latter finding would support the idea that the dark material is 'normal' matter (such as burned-out stars), rather than weakly-interacting particles that have not yet been observed on Earth.<br/><br/>The investigators also intend to study another gravitational problem: the orbits of stars that experience a gravitational force that is not always the same, but varies with time. An example is that of a star belonging to a small galaxy that follows an elliptical orbit around a much larger galaxy -- our Milky Way has several such satellites. As the satellite swoops in low, the increased gravitational force of the Milky Way can remove stars from its outer regions. The PI has developed a novel method, that of 'invariant loops', that will be used to tackle this problem, and to find which stars will remain with the satellite and which will be stripped from it. It will then be possible to use observations of stars around these small galaxies, now being gathered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and other surveys, to measure the gravitational force of the satellite galaxy in comparison to that of the Milky Way. In this way the masses of the satellites can be estimated and their 'dark matter' content calculated. Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).<br/>***|0

The nascent dark matter project will take advantage of the expertise in and facilities for low background methods accumulated by the Borexino collaboration in over two decades of research. DarkSide-50 will take advantage of the Borexino Counting Test Facility (CTF) and of the scintillator and water purification equipment built at the underground lab at Gran Sasso, Italy by the Borexino collaboration. While the Borexino and DarkSide collaborations remain two separate entities, almost all of the Borexino groups have joined the DarkSide Collaboration, and will work on both activities.<br/><br/>Borexino is a detector designed to observe low-energy solar neutrinos. It is the most recent large-scale, real-time solar neutrino detector to become operational and has been in operation for a little more than three years, during which time it has acquired solar and terrestrial neutrino data. The solar neutrino goal is to improve the measurement of Beryllium-7 neutrinos to an uncertainty less than 5%, and to make the first real time measurements of other neutrino branches, especially the pep, and possibly also the pp and CNO neutrinos. DarkSide-50 is a 50-kg dual-phase argon detector under development for the direct detection of dark matter particles. It is designed to test innovative low background methods to ensure background-free operation. It will initiate the use of underground argon for dark matter applications. It will be deployed, enclosed in a liquid scintillator neutron veto, within the CTF water tank. The scintillator-water combined shield provides background-free operation for ton-year exposures.<br/><br/>For Broader Impacts, the proposed activity will advance the scientific and educational mission in a variety of ways: (1) it will offer an excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will have a chance to contribute to the success of a cutting edge project in fundamental science and advanced engineering; (2) it will benefit society by developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging; and (3) it will support continued development of successful E&O programs such as the Princeton-Abruzzo-South Dakota summer school for high school students.|0

When high energy cosmic rays interact with matter, magnetic fields and ambient photons they generate high energy gamma rays and/or neutrinos of high energy. Some of these neutral particles travel directly to the earth and, when observed by gamma ray telescopes, can both provide essential information about not only the origin and distribution of cosmic rays and their sources, but also can serve as probes for gamma rays expected from the annihilation of dark matter. Thus they allow the study fundamental high energy astrophysics as well as particle physics. As the flux of these high energy gamma rays is small, large acceptance detectors with good pointing and adequate cosmic ray rejection capabilities are essential for this study. <br/><br/>The Milagro detector uses a new technique to detect high energy gamma rays. It allows the simultaneous and continuous viewing of the entire overhead sky in the TeV energy domain. It detects the bundles of energetic particles produced by high energy gamma ray interacting in the atmosphere, which acts like an amplifier of each high energy photon. Detection occurs by sampling light photons produced by these relativistic particles in a 6 million gallon water tank instrumented with 737 photomultiplier tubes. The pulse height and arrival times of these photons permit reconstruction of the celestial direction of the original particle, as well as rejection of most of the unwanted cosmic ray showers. Its continuous operation allows observation of both steady and transient sources of TeV gamma rays. <br/><br/>Milagro has detected and measured the energy spectrum of gamma rays from the Crab neubla; from active galactic nuclei (AGNS) blazars Mrk 501 and 421 in their active phases; from a gamma ray burster (GRB); and of diffuse TeV gamma ray emission from the inner galactic disc region from interaction of cosmic rays with matter in the galactic disc, and from TeV gamma ray sources in the Cygnus arm of the galaxy. These observations provide new and important data for the understanding of the origin, acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays. Under this NSF grant, work will continue on refining the observations of these and other possible objects, and on analyzing the data.<br/><br/>The Milagro experiment and data have provided excellent training ground for undergraduate student research experience and for graduate student training in hardware and software. UCI also has several active programs, such as COSMOS and Quarknet , for outreach to K-12 teachers and students. We have been involved in communicating to school students at K-12 levels and to seniors (Academy of Continued Life Long learning).|0

Since data acquisition started in 2007, Borexino has reached its design goal and measured the flux of mono-energetic 7-Beryllium solar neutrinos with enough precision to test the predictions of current solar models. After a scintillator purification campaign in 2011, Borexino is in a new phase of solar neutrino physics with the goal of measuring the entire solar neutrino spectrum. A precise knowledge of solar neutrinos will allow us to understand how the sun and other stars work, test the MSW-LMA neutrino oscillation paradigm and search for deviations from it. Borexino will possibly resolve an open question on the metallicity of the Sun's core, an important piece of information with which to study the evolution of larger stars in the universe. <br/><br/>DarkSide-50, a dual-phase time projection chamber scheduled to come online in late 2012, will prototype design solutions for background free multi-tonne detectors with liquid argon as active target for WIMPs. A null observation would exclude some of the current leading dark matter candidates. A positive detection would begin to give answers to one of the big scientific unknowns of our times. DarkSide-50 will run with 50 kg of argon depleted more than 100-fold in the radioactive 39-Argon isotope. The DarkSide-50 Argon cryostat is surrounded by a compact, liquid scintillator neutron detector and immersed in the Borexino Counting Test Facility (CTF) water tank instrumented and operated as a Cherenkov muon veto. The Borexino and DarkSide collaborations have a significant overlap in personnel and technical and operational resources. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The Borexino and DarkSide projects provide excellent opportunities for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in applications of software and hardware development, and fundamental physics. The techniques developed for Borexino and Darkside-50 can more broadly benefit technology relevant for medical imaging, nuclear non-proliferation and geology.|0

Besides, there are numerous theoretical arguments that hint to New Physics, NP, (e.g. super-symmetry, extra dimensions, little Higgs) so that we expect a wealth of new data at the LHC. Probing the microscopic properties of Dark Matter, as predicted by most of the NP scenarios, has emerged as another objective of the searches at the LHC after the confirmation by recent cosmological measurements that the Universe contains a significant Dark Matter component.The emergence of these new paradigms means it is of utmost importance to update and renew our approach to searches of the Higgs and the NP at the LHC, get acquainted with the new models and be equipped with the tools and software to conduct future analyses to dig out the new signals. At the same time, it is important to be in control of all the predictions of our current theory. This calls for the development of sophisticated SM codes.

In recent years, scientists have put together a remarkably successful model of cosmic evolution and the extraordinarily well tested Standard Model of elementary particles. In the current cosmological model, a rapid burst of expansion - inflation - occurred a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang, laying the seeds for the formation of structure in the Universe. Those seeds have been observed as hot and cold regions in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The assembly of galaxies from those seeds and the vast web of large-scale structure seen in galaxy surveys was shaped by dark matter, which dominates the mass in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Finally, the evidence that the cosmic expansion is now accelerating has become incontrovertible, pointing to a Universe dominated by dark energy or else to a modification of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.<br/><br/>The success of the current cosmology rests upon its three mysterious pillars - inflation, particle dark matter, and dark energy - mysterious because they lie outside the Standard Model of particle physics. Cosmology has shown that the Standard Model is incomplete, and that there is new physics waiting to be discovered. In the coming decade, cosmology can help reveal the new physics underlying inflation, dark matter, and cosmic acceleration, and thereby play a critical role in pointing the way to a new paradigm for fundamental physics. The Physics Frontier Center at the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics (KICP) will bring together astronomers and physicists, theorists, observers and experimentalists, and early-career scientists and senior researchers from across the cosmology community. Since the complexity of these problems requires multiple, complementary approaches, the Center will enable datasets from different experiments to be combined in powerful new ways. As new discoveries are made, the Center will pursue new directions to promptly follow them up. <br/><br/>Building upon the accomplishments, investments, and lessons learned over the past ten years of PFC funding, the Center focuses upon reaping the science from the projects that were initiated and developed at the KICP - South Pole Telescope (SPT), Dark Energy Survey (DES), Q/U Imaging Experiment (QUIET), and Chicagoland Observatory for Underground Particle Physics (COUPP) - and elsewhere to help solve these big mysteries. Built around the projects, the Center includes eight Major Activities (MAs), five research Hubs, an international Fellows exchange program, yearly hands-on summer schools, and multiple Education & Outreach partnerships. Twenty-one key collaborators have committed to carrying out specific tasks central to the Center. They come from local institutions, education and outreach partners, institutions around the country, and industry. <br/><br/>Three science MAs are devoted to our research themes: the Inflation MA will take advantage of dramatic advances in measuring CMB polarization to pursue the ""Bmode"" polarization signature of inflation-produced gravity waves, focusing initially on QUIET and SPTpol while laying the groundwork for future experiments. It will also combine CMB and large-scale structure measurements from DES to test whether the underlying density perturbations are Gaussian, as predicted by the simplest models of inflation. The Dark Energy MA will use the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and South Pole Telescope (SPT) and other future projects to probe the physical origin of cosmic acceleration and test the current paradigm - vacuum energy within Einstein's theory of gravity. The Dark Matter MA will synthesize the upcoming wealth of data from particle colliders, satellites, and ultra-sensitive dark matter detectors to confirm or refute the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) hypothesis for dark matter.<br/><br/>Within the three science MAs, five research ""Hubs"" will bring people and projects together to focus on specific challenges. The CMB Polarization Hub will facilitate coordination between different polarization experiments, including joint analysis; the non-Gaussianity Hub will bring together international researchers to constrain or detect non-Gaussianity and test inflation. The Joint Analysis Hub will bring together researchers on SPT and DES and other projects to develop and apply new tools to exploit and optimize galaxy clusters as probes of dark energy; the Supernova Hub will carry out a broad program to improve supernovae as cosmological distance indicators and apply these techniques to new surveys. The Dark Matter Hub will focus on particle theory and model building and signals for dark matter from colliders and indirect detection experiments, complementing the direct detection experiment COUPP and others.<br/><br/>The Fellows MA is the centerpiece activity of the Center. Mentored by the faculty of the Center but given great independence, eleven early-career scientists will be able to shape research programs of their own design, work with faculty, other Fellows, students, and visitors in the interdisciplinary environment of the Center. They can also participate in an international Fellows exchange program and choose from a broad range of opportunities in education and outreach. All of this is designed to prepare them to be future leaders in cosmology.<br/><br/>Two MAs are devoted to crosscutting, science-enabling activities. Detector Development, strongly leveraged by partnerships with Argonne, Fermilab, and other institutions, will develop innovative detectors to position us to take advantage of early discoveries and to broadly benefit cosmology and other areas of science. Computational Cosmology will coordinate the high-performance computing resources, both human and hardware, necessary to accomplish our science goals. The Conferences, Workshops, and Visitors MA will provide a program of specialized workshops, large symposia, yearly hands-on summer schools, and a visitors program featuring the David Schramm Distinguished Visiting Professorship to engage and benefit the broader cosmology community and further our science goals.<br/><br/>By design, the broader impacts of the PFC are woven throughout the Center activities. More specifically, the Education, Outreach, & Diversity MA, will spearhead and coordinate a series of activities aimed at broadening the impact of the Center. This MA is strongly coupled to the science in the Center, involves 100% of the PFC faculty members, and has three overarching goals: increasing the diversity of the STEM workforce through programs from K-12 to the professoriate; educating and preparing the next generation of teacher-scholars in an interdisciplinary environment by involving students and Fellows directly in outreach and teaching activities; and advancing the public's understanding and appreciation of science through collaborations with museums and planetariums, and through public lectures and events. This approach to broadening participation includes collaboration with Project Exploration working with the Chicago Public Schools, continuation of the successful Space Explorers K-12 program, partnering with the Fisk-Vanderbilt Masters-to-PhD Bridge program and the University of Texas El Paso to bring students to UChicago for research experiences, supporting and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, and championing diversity in faculty hiring and retention within the Physical Sciences Division at UChicago. The Center will also use technology, developing visualization tools, to integrate research into the undergraduate curriculum and will partner with the Adler Planetarium on cosmology visualizations for a broader audience. Finally, the Conferences, Workshops, and Visitors MA will promote dissemination of cutting-edge research to the broader cosmology community and offer opportunities for those not currently engaged in cosmology research to transition into the field."|0

The problem then is to find new physics which will stabilize these parameters and which will do so without fine tuning the parameters of the new physics. <br/><br/>The PI proposes to investigate two different approaches to the problem: one makes use of supersymmetry at the weak scale, and the other does not use supersymmetry, but treats the Higgs boson as a pseudo-Goldstone Boson. It turns out that these approaches will have distinctive features which have implications for experiments at the Tevatron and LHC and so so are highly relevant to the field. there are also important implications for Cosmology, including the issues of dark matter, dark energy, nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background. The PI plans thoroughly to explore all of these aspects of EWSB. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposal are mainly concerned with the training of graduate students and postdocs at the university and at summer schools, but also contain a worthwhile outreach program to high schools and the general public.|0

Galaxy surveys can include only objects above a given size and apparent brightness. When light from a background galaxy passes close to a dense region on its way to us, its light is bent ('lensed') so that it appears brighter and larger than otherwise. This bias introduces an illusory concentration of faint distant galaxies in the same parts of the sky as nearby concentrations of matter. A preliminary calculation shows that selection bias could change some measured quantities by as much as 10%. Dr Dodelson will undertake more detailed calculations, including an analysis of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations prepared for the Dark Energy Survey, and studies of how galaxy images are distinguished from those of stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. His aim is to understand how selection bias is likely to affect future large surveys to measure dark energy with weak lensing, and to develop analysis methods that minimize it. Current ideas about the particles making up the dark matter predict that they should have finite lifetimes, so that gamma ray telescopes such as Fermi would detect thousands of photons produced when dark matter particles annihilate. However, the 'background' of gamma rays from our own Milky Way, and from the active nuclei of galaxies, is far brighter. Dr Dodelson will explore methods to extract the dark matter signal from the background.<br/><br/>A graduate student will be trained by participating in the research. Dr Dodelson plays a significant role in large collaborations including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Dark Energy Survey, and the SuperNova Acceleration Probe, which aim at constraining the fundamental physics that gives rise to the dark energy.|0

By examining extensions of the Higgs sector, the group will find ways to test the minimal models of supersymmetry and to distinguish among various models using data. This will also tie into tests of lepton flavor violation through Higgs decays, a phenomenon deeply connected to the ongoing efforts to study neutrino masses and mixings. Finally, connections will be explored between the physics of the Higgs boson, supersymmetry and the astrophysical problems of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the universe. In so doing, the group seeks to increase our understanding of physics which is not readily measured in experiment, such as the source of the neutrino masses and the properties of the dark matter correlated with experimental signatures for SUSY at the LHC.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, this project includes continued outreach to the Notre Dame academic community through new and innovative courses in modern physics for non-science majors, work on improving academic advising throughout the university, and programs designed to increase the number of Notre Dame students pursuing graduate studies in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

These equations, whose mathematical study is still in its infancy, have recently found a significant application as effective descriptions for the dynamical evolution of self-gravitating, relativistic matter. Based on this physical motivation, the PI's proposed research aims at understanding the qualitative behavior of solutions to these model equations. In particular, great emphasis is put on the pseudo-relativistic Hartree equation whose focusing nonlinearity is of critical strength in the sense that large initial data can lead to finite-time blow-up of the solution. Here it is of paramount interest to gain analytical insight into blow-up rates and dynamics, as well as to prove existence of non-radial blow-up solutions, thereby extending the PI's previous results on radial blow-up for the pseudo-relativistic Hartree equation (in collaboration with J. Froehlich). Apart from the issue of finite-time blow-up, the PI proposes a detailed study of global-in-time solutions and their asymptotic behavior as time tends to infinity. <br/><br/>Dispersive partial differential equations provide meeting grounds for theoretical and empirical branches of the natural sciences. The mathematical study of pseudo-relativistic Schroedinger equations substantiates intuitive and numerical insights into physical models of theoretical astrophysics. One of the most outstanding problems that astrophysics is facing today is the so-called dark matter problem. Various theoretical models set forth the existence of boson stars as possible candidates for explaining this empirical puzzle. The pseudo-relativistic Hartree equation considered in this proposal serves as an effective description for the dynamical evolution of boson stars. Therefore, this nonlinear dispersive PDE provides analytical testing grounds for these theoretical objects|0

During primordial inflation there is a vast enhancement of quantum effects, which are ordinarily very small. Another significant feature of primordial inflation is that these quantum effects become fossilized so that they can be detected by current observers. The goals of this study are, among others, to work out how quantum effects arise from primordial inflation, to settle the long-standing controversy over whether or not the self-gravitation of particles produced during inflation can slow down the expansion of the universe and to investigate modified gravity theories which might describe the current universe.<br/><br/>Such a study is interesting because there is a vast reservoir of largely untapped data in the radiation from the very early structures which can be seen at great distances. This data offers sensitivity to energy scales and physical laws far beyond those that can be reached in accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider. This project will promote teaching, training and learning. To this end, the PI will continue serving as a host in the University of Florida's Junior Science, Engineering and Humanities Symposium. These presentations typically involve simple explanations of, for example, why galactic rotation curves suggest dark matter. Then the PI discusses how students can prepare for a career in theoretical physics. The PI will also continue to deliver colloquia based on his 2009 review article, ""How Far Are We from the Quantum Theory of Gravity?"" in Reports on Progress in Physics. These colloquia are accessible to interested but non-specialist physicists, and to graduate students new to the field."|0

The latter is currently the most sensitive dark matter experiment in operation underground with a target at the 100 kg mass scale. <br/><br/>The group will develop and test a two-phase Xe TPC prototype to validate the design of the next generation XENON1T experiment.

At the same time, one has to demonstrate the liquid xenon purity required to allow ionization electrons to drift across such large detectors. The Collaboration has designed a detector system which will be able to address these and other questions relevant to XENON1T. The goal is to get results within one year, and most of the equipment items could also be used in the actual XENON1T development.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this award comes about since the XENON science addresses questions about fundamental properties of the Universe, with all the ingredients to captivate the interest and imagination of students and the general public alike.

Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground.<br/><br/>The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low temperature phonon-mediated detectors to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and distinguish them from backgrounds. CDMS is currently operating at Soudan, Minnesota with 10 kg of iZIP detectors, which have already demonstrated a background rejection factor sufficient for zero background operation with several hundred kilogram targets. In order to fully use this capability, it is necessary to build a new larger and cleaner experimental set up and locate it at a much deeper site than Soudan to eliminate the cosmogenic neutron background. The baseline design of this new experiment (SuperCDMS SNOLAB) calls for a 100 kg germanium experiment located at SNOLAB, Sudbury, Canada adapting the iZIP technology to 100 mm diameter detectors of 1.4 kg mass each.<br/><br/>This award provides support for Research and Development towards this experiment. It focuses on critical R&D goals: the testing and characterization of the proposed detectors, contribution to the design and testing of the cold hardware and electronics (novel HEMT and SQUID for ionization and phonon readout), and the procurement and characterization of the germanium crystals. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: The SuperCDMS experiment will have a broad impact which extends beyond the dark matter search. The technical development will further advance phonon-mediated detectors, which have already found many applications in cosmology, astronomy and industry.

At those early times, normal matter in the form of gas would have been evenly mixed with the dark matter. The team will then use smooth-particle hydrodynamic simulations to follow the combined development of the dark matter and the gas, under various assumptions about how the gas is turned into stars, and how those stars feed energy back into the intergalactic gas.

The present rapid progress of both micro-, as witness the headline ""LHC"" results, and cosmo-scales, such as the newest ""Planck"" maps, puts welcome pressure on theory. Our work is on the ""deep"" theory side, attempting to find hints of possible generalizations of the ""standard model"", Einstein Gravity, that account for the deviations from its otherwise spectacular successes. Here we especially mean the apparent need for dark matter, which we hope to reduce to geometrical effects rather than by adding on Ptolemaic particles, without giving up the beauty of geometry. Thus, part of our efforts will be to continue our very recent results that exclude the currently popular ""massive Gravity"", because the latter loses all the beauty of geometry, instead unleashing too many variants and losing the tightness of geometrical description. Indeed, just as the Yang-Mills field theory counterparts of General Relativity were shown to exclude massive extensions, but relied instead on the now LHC-observed Higgs field, it looks as if the beautiful ""isolated"" nature of our basic interacting ""glue"" theories, Yang -Mills and Maxwell, will extend to gravity as well. On the constructive side, we intend to look for--less fundamental ""effective"", non-local but still geometrical, laws that replace the fuzziness of dark matter by additional terms that exploit the freedom remaining in the ""Einstein"" picture. <br/><br/>In more accessible terms, let us place our efforts within the present framework of front-line Physics, one that has received much recent media attention both in the Laboratory--especially the discovery of the ""Higgs"" field at the LHC accelerator, and at the opposite end of our universe-- by for example the newest spectacular pictures presented by the Planck, and other Cosmic observatories, of our entire Universe as it looked a mere third of a million years into its expansion the its present 13 billion. Our aim is to understand such general features of our world by--as conservative as possible--extensions of Einstein's General Relativity to account for Dark Matter and other unexpected new large-scale features. The conservative part of our program is to exclude candidates that go too far, by violating the (by now familiar) picture of curved space that General Relativity presents. So our twofold approach keeps a tight rein on that good, ""geometrical"", part of our hard-won picture of the Universe, while extending its reach within this realm, in particular by exploring different ways in which matter and geometry can interact there. We may be sure that the observational surprises will stay ahead of our inventive abilities, but that's the bootstrap that always works, and illuminates our world!"|0

This ""dark matter"" is detected dynamically, through its effects on the structuring of galaxies, clusters of galaxies and larger scale structures in the universe.

Charged particles traversing the superheated fluid in bubble chambers deposit heat which creates small bubbles of gas. These bubbles expand explosively unless the chamber is quickly pressurized. The bubbles can be photographed before pressurization revealing the paths of these particles, so the chamber is an excellent amplifier of tiny particle signals.

In his research, Professor Tucker-Smith studies extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, with an emphasis on understanding how these theories can be tested at the LHC. As part of this project, Professor Tucker-Smith will study models that address a surprising experimental development from the Tevatron at Fermilab --- measurements of an anomalously large forward-backward asymmetry in top-antitop production. He will also study the LHC phenomenology of theories with a particular type of new force carrier, theories incorporating new ideas for dark matter, and theories in which the Higgs sector, the part of the model responsible for generating the masses of the elementary particles, differs from that of the Standard Model.<br/><br/>This project will also have signficant broader impacts. Undergraduate involvement is a central part of the Professor Tucker-Smith's research program.

The research project is aimed at dwarf galaxies in the local group. The current measured population abundance of dwarf galaxies is less than what is predicted from the mass spectrum of cold-dark-matter halos. Theoretical explanations for this predict different shapes of the faint end of the luminosity function making this a discriminant between theories of galaxy formation. The Principal Investigator will carefully measure the membership of 15 poor clusters or groups up to a distance of ~260 million light years. He has developed new techniques and algorithms for rejecting background objects from photometry and template spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, reaching galaxies 1000 times fainter than the Milky Way over a large enough volume to establish a representative sample of the universe. The program began observations at the 4m telescope of the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in April 2005 and at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in September 2005. This research will be of importance to the fields of galaxy evolution, structure formation and dark matter. <br/><br/>An important auxiliary program is being carried out by undergraduate and graduate students using a 0.9m telescope. Future observations will serve as the culminating experience for the next generation of students at the San Francisco State University, a predominantly undergraduate teaching university. This hands-on, collaborative research experience is an essential part of the university's astronomy program, which serves a diverse group of students aiming for careers in astronomy, public school teaching, and industry.|0

Generic extensions of the standard model of subatomic particles predict the existence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS), which are excellent candidates for the dark matter. These are expected to interact with ordinary matter rarely and thus be extremely difficult to detect. The COUPP and PICASSO groups are developing new large dark matter detectors derived from the well-known bubble chamber technique. Charged particles traversing the superheated fluid in bubble chambers deposit heat, which creates small bubbles of gas. The bubbles can be photographed before pressurization revealing the paths of these particles. Other non-dark matter triggers can also lead to runaway boiling. These have limited classical chambers to remain in a superheated state for only a short time. The COUPP experiment has paid special attention to material selection and manufacturing techniques to remove roughness and radiocontamination to allow the superheated state to be long lived. The PICASSO experiment suspends superheated fluid droplets in a gel whose surfaces are so smooth that the droplets can stay in a superheated state indefinitely. Both experiments have made the superheated state sufficiently long lived to search for dark matter. <br/><br/>This award will allow the PI to continue his work on the COUPP and PICASSO experiments. The sound sensors produced by the Indiana University group have been used for rejecting cosmic ray induced events and distinguishing the radioactive signals for moderately superheated fluids. The PI and his students have built equipment to test the sound sensors under realistic conditions mimicking those in the detectors and to measure changes in their sensitivity as a function of age. The group has also taken on the task of measuring contaminants in the fluid target and is now prepared to routinely assay the fluid.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: Enhancing the education of undergraduates is an integral part of this program. Undergraduates, high school teachers and students have participated in design, construction and characterization of acoustic transducers, measurement of radioactivity, and other projects. In addition, the PI and his group has provided acoustic sensors to other scientific groups to assist in other experiments.|0

The observations target dwarf galaxies in the Local Group which have been discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). These faint, low-density, spheroidal, systems have experience tidal interactions and their stellar populations are stirred up. Another target is the apparently less disturbed, irregular Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) galaxy that is more remote from the Milky Way's dark matter halo. The observations may help to distinguish between primordial objects made in dark matter halos, and objects formed in tidal interactions between galaxies. <br/><br/>A large number of stars in the fields of these newly discovered dwarfs ystems has already been observed with the Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5m and the CTIO 4-m telescopes. Here the Washington and Stromgren photometry of stellar populations is completed and analyzed to obtain stellar metallicities and ages. Additional low-resolution spectroscopy is used to further probe metallicities, and check on the memberships of the observed stars. In turn, this information constrains the initial mass functions and star formation histories of these faint dwarf systems. <br/><br/>This project supports research at an undergraduate institution and will introduce several undergraduate students to scientific research.|0

While the SM has been successful in explaining many phenomena observed in the laboratory to date, it offers no insight into experimental facts such as the dominance of matter over anti-matter, nor the nature of dark matter and dark energy, which are associated with the rotation curves of the galaxies and the accelerated expansion of the universe. Searching for physics beyond the Standard Model is therefore a well-motivated and important task for physicists. A good way to search for new physics is through tests of fundamental symmetries in different interactions.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to test fundamental symmetries in the electromagnetic and strong interactions via precision measurements on the properties of neutral particles: neutral pion and eta. The radiative decay width of the neutral pion plays a key role that bridges chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking and our understanding of QCD (a theory describing the strong interaction). On the other hand, the measurement of the eta radiative decay width will reveal the effect of explicit symmetry breakings of chiral symmetry, isospin, and SU(3) by the light-quark masses. In addition, the measurements of branching ratios or upper limits for various rare and forbidden decays of the eta will provide sensitive probes to test the violations of charge conjugation C, parity P, and time reversal T, as well as CP symmetries, and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The results of this project will provide clues to some important questions, such as: ""why is our observed universe dominated by matter over anti-matter?"", and ""what are the masses of the light quarks?""<br/><br/>This project will engage undergraduate students as key contributors.

The goal of (1) is to derive the observed masses and mixings of quarks and leptons from a more fundamental theory. In the case of (2), the PI hopes to develop the collider phenomenology of certain unified models which predict light exotic states.

Combining the analysis of observations with theory, methods will be used that complement and expand the traditional approach. A full scale Bayesian probabilistic analysis of satellite galaxy kinematics, using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, will probe the (mainly dark matter) mass distribution in the peripheral regions of isolated galaxies. A related part of the crisis, the galaxy content of nearby voids, will be analyzed with shallow samples over a large magnitude range, which will then be compared with cosmological simulations. Finally, the accuracy of the reconstruction of mass profiles from rotation curves must depend on galaxy type, and small variations can significantly mar the mass estimates. Therefore, the present research includes the production of publicly available models of disk galaxies embedded in realistic cosmological dark matter halos. <br/><br/>The intent is to raise the quality and reliability of results coming from satellite dynamics, and along the way train two female graduate students and provide catalogs and numerical models to the entire community.|0

Data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has begun to reveal the physics of the TeV scale but there is much still to be discovered, including the nature of dark matter and the resolution of the hierarchy problem. Professor Graham will calculate the consequences of recent LHC results for well-motivated theories of physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry. It is anticipated that this project will lead to the discovery of new types of experimental signals that can be probed at the LHC, including different types of displaced vertices and fractionally charged particles. Additionally, Professor Graham will design a new type of dark-matter detector.

Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) that were produced moments after the Big Bang. Such particles would represent an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics, such as supersymmetry or additional dimensions. If WIMPs exist and are the dark matter, then their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector. The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Collaboration has pioneered the use of low-temperature phonon-mediated devices to detect the rare scattering of WIMPs on nuclei and to distinguish these events from other background interactions. One of many key technological requirements for the scaling to greater mass of the low-temperature germanium technology is improvement in the cryogenic preamplifiers of both phonon and ionization signals. The superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) preamplifiers used in the present Soudan facility were produced and evaluated through the efforts of this group several years ago, and the group has been an integral member of the collaboration in optimizing their performance throughout the operation of the various CDMS experiments at Soudan. <br/><br/>This award will support the scientific aspects of the CDMS programs in four complementary directions, fully coordinated within the collaboration: (a) support of the SuperCDMS-Soudan experiment (participating in operation of the Soudan experiment, particularly oversight and maintenance of the phonon readout system), (b) contribution to the design of SuperCDMS-SNOLAB (design optimization of cold hardware and electronics), (c) scientific support to SuperCDMS-SNOLAB construction (production testing of SuperCDMS-SNOLAB SQUIDs and room-temperature electronics), and (d) long-term R&D towards GEODM (SQUID-based ionization readout). Continued development of the cryogenic readout systems is a critical component of the science goals of the SuperCDMS and GEODM programs.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This program's technological development will also push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors, the applications of which are increasingly widespread.

The distribution, kinematics, and chemical composition of halo stars can be used to back-track the formation history of the halo which formed by mergers of small galaxies and star associations. The tidal interaction of the Milky Way galaxy with dwarf galaxies or stellar clusters also led to tidally stripped stars which are now traceable as tidal streams in the galactic halo. This characterizes the galactic gravitational potential from stellar motions and the distribution of dark matter. <br/><br/>New tidal streams are searched for and known streams better characterized using photometric and spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, SDSS II, & SDSS III) and methodologies developed in previous work by the investigators. The results from this study will lead to three dimensional density model of the Milky Way halo, including its smooth component, streams and other substructure, over the 12,600 square degrees of high Galactic latitude sky imaged by the SDSS. <br/><br/>The observations are used to build a realistic spatial model of the density distribution of stars in spheroid globular cluster and dwarf galaxy tidal debris streams in the Milky Way?s halo. When combined with radial velocities, these data will better constrain the gravitational potential of the Milky Way. This in turn helps to determine the density structure of the dark matter by matching orbits and N-body simulations to multiple tidal debris streams simultaneously. It is an advantage to consider more than one tidal debris stream at a time and that more realistic potential models are used. Including the distribution properties and density of stars along the tidal debris stream rather than only using their average position and velocity is another advantage for models that aim to constrain the gravitational halo potential and the mass distribution in our galaxy. <br/><br/>Two graduate students, and 3 undergraduate student researchers will participate in this project which will help to train the next generation of scientists.

The research will be largely analytic, checked by comparison with cosmological N-body simulations. In ellipsoidal collapse, three numbers determine the fate of each halo: the local overdensity of dark matter, and two quantities related to the ellipticity and prolateness of the surrounding distribution of mass. Thus the abundance and the formation history of dark halos depend on the surrounding large-scale structure: the halo population in filaments of the cosmic web should be different from that in sheets and voids. Dr Sheth will calculate how ellipsoidal collapse should affect the relation between 2-point, 3-point and higher-order clustering statistics. The next generation of galaxy surveys will measure these quantities to within a few percent. This work is essential for interpreting those measurements accurately, to estimate the level of fluctuations in the dark-matter density and determine how its distribution differs from that of the luminous galaxies.<br/><br/>A graduate student will be trained by participating in this research.

Both the characteristics of dark matter and its distribution within the universe provide important constraints on any theory of the fundamental forces of nature. Precise measurements of the distribution of dark matter via weak lensing, made in parallel with direct observations of high mass particles produced at the Tevatron and/or the LHC, direct observations of dark matter in the laboratory, and indirect observations of the interactions or decays of dark matter in astrophysics experiments will lead to a fundamental unification of physics at the smallest and largest scales. Now the Standard Model does not include a candidate for the cold dark matter which is so much more abundant than its baryonic cousin.

They bring experience working in large collaborations, with tremendously large datasets, where reducing and understanding systematic uncertainties is critical to the science.

WIMPs may be detected by their collisions with nuclei, but the expected low rate and low energy of the recoil nuclei present daunting size and background requirements for the detector. Liquid argon is an excellent scintillation and ionization detector and has unique features that make it particularly attractive for detection of WIMP dark matter. <br/><br/>The authors propose to contribute to the development of liquid argon as a detector for WIMPs. During the past year the Princeton group participated in development and tests of the 3.2-kg WARP liquid argon detector at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy. The results of the tests are very positive and demonstrate the feasibility of a sensitive WIMP search with a large-scale LAr detector. They propose to increase their involvement in the development and operation of larger liquid argon detectors, with the next step being a 140-kg detector. Except for critical electronics that is requested in this proposal, the 140-kg WARP detector is funded and under construction. Commissioning is expected to occur in Summer 2007. <br/><br/>The research plan consists of the following three goals: 1) Pulse Shape Discrimination: further development of pulse shape discrimination with new 0.5-1 GHz transient digitizers (1-2 ns digitization). 2) Light Collection: the PIs propose to investigate ways to improve the light collection system, including the possibility of adding an array of PMTs in liquid argon at the bottom of the detector. 3) Underground Argon: the radioactive 39Ar found in commercial argon, which is due to cosmic ray interactions with the argon in the atmosphere, produces a significant beta background in argon detectors. It is likely that argon with a low content of 39Ar could be obtained from natural gas wells. Gas that originates from the Earth's mantle, such as at the CO2 gas wells in Northeast New Mexico, should have a very low level of 39Ar. <br/><br/>The development of US sources for geological argon would have many broader impacts applications to low background counting, in addition to WIMP searches, and would be a major asset for the upcoming Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL). The study of geological argon also constitutes a good example of scientific cooperation between two of the disciplines involved in the DUSEL, physics and geology.|0

The topics to be covered are at the forefront of research topics in particle and nuclear physics and will explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. The study of neutrino physics and dark matter is of high interest to particle and nuclear physicists and astrophysicists. The ongoing and proposed dark matter and neutrino experiments are expected to unveil the answers to critical questions asked by scientists for last few decades. Recent precise measurements of all the neutrino mixing angles necessitate a theoretical roadmap for the future. Understanding the nature of dark matter better would help to understand the composition of the cosmos better. <br/><br/>The scope of the 2012 summer CETUP* program will include the ""Dark Matter"" program followed by a three day interlude program (July 19-21) comprising of ""Dark Matter, Neutrino Physics and Unification."" Following that, there will be a week and a half long focused theory session on ""Neutrino Physics and Unification"" and a 3-day long Physics Working Group workshop of Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) (July 30 - August 1).<br/><br/>Among the Broader Impacts, understanding neutrino properties better could have significant implications in astrophysics and cosmology, and may offer solutions to the current puzzles such as the abundance of matter over antimatter in the Universe. Outreach efforts will aim to share the excitement of this research with K-12 students and general public. Selected CETUP* participants will give three public lectures that outline the importance of dark matter and neutrino research. Such presentations at a level comprehensible by the general public are important for developing public support for national investment in basic science. South Dakota Public Broadcasting will record and stream the lectures state wide as well as post it on their website for those who couldn't participate live. They also will be working with the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation to reach out to Native American students and include them in the educational activities at the CETUP* as well as organize an informal get together with the students and discuss their interests in science and possible future STEM career opportunities."|0

Motivated by the great interest and excitement over the recent improved WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) search limits from CDMS-II, the collaboration is considering ways to explore substantially greater regions of possible WIMP cross sections. It is clear that there is substantial scientific interest in mounting experiments with an eventual sensitivity reach more than a factor of a thousand beyond the current limits, a level that would test much of the theoretically allowed parameter space. Some of this will be achieved with continued running of CDMS-II, but that will become background limited before it can reach the desired level. However, the CDMS-II technology is capable of reaching this level of sensitivity with a substantial increase in mass, reduction in background events, and relocation to a deeper underground site.<br/><br/>With continued development efforts in detector fabrication and testing, and a coordinated program aimed at background identification and reduction, an experiment with 25 kg of detector mass could be operational by 2008. The cryogenics system of this experiment would be planned to allow further expansion, so that additional improvements in mass production and testing of detectors could yield a phased increase in detector mass up to 1000 kg.<br/><br/>The CDMS-II collaboration proposes to continue running that apparatus to the end of 2006 to obtain the best limit achievable with that apparatus. Concurrently, a detector R&D project will proceed to develop SuperCDMS, the 25 kg detector, to be housed in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory Laboratory in Canada. This individual proposal from the University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center represents a request for support of the PI's long-term development of cryogenic electronics systems for improved detector technology and increased sensitivity.

A broad range of observations from galaxies and superclusters to distant supernovae and the cosmic microwave background radiation, tell us that nearly 90% of the matter in the universe is in some new form, different from ordinary particles. So far, going back to Zwicky's observations of the Coma cluster in the 1930's, this matter has revealed itself only through gravity, and is referred to as ""dark matter"" because it neither emits nor absorbs light. <br/> A leading hypothesis, which we propose to continue testing, is that the dark matter is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, a hypothetical elementary particle produced moments after the Big Bang in collisions of ordinary matter. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their local density in our region of the Milky Way makes them detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in a terrestrial detector. Natural WIMP candidates come from Supersymmetry (SUSY), an extension to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Supersymmetric extensions of the SM solve a number of outstanding problems in particle physics, among them the so-called gauge hierarchy problem. These problems are completely distinct from riddles posed by astrophysics and cosmology. Perhaps not coincidently, SUSY particles have just the right properties to be the dark matter. The search for WIMP dark matter in the galactic halo and the large accelerator-based experiments at Fermilab's Tevatron and those under construction at CERN's Large Hadron Collider are, in a complementary fashion, searching for the same fundamental physics. <br/> Our group, as part of the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) collaboration, is conducting the CDMSII dark matter experiment which is currently running a 5-kg detector array in the Soudan Mine. The latest CDMSII result (July 2005) set the most stringent bound to date - by a factor of ten over all other experiments in the world - on the presence of WIMPs in the galactic halo, and has begun to constrain some of the parameter space where SUSY particles could lie. With support from this award, we will acquire a year of data with this full array, the analysis of which will allow an additional order of magnitude in sensitivity. <br/> Our group has plyaed a significant role in building the experiment using our detector test facility at Case, as well as building and operating the main apparatus at Soudan. In addition, have conducted background studies and data analyses that have been central to extracting the science. To date, four Case graduate students have completed their Ph.D.'s on the experiment, and currently two third year students on actively contributing to detector operations, Monte Carlo simulations and analysis. In the coming two years, these students, together with the PI's and research associates (postdocs), will continue travelling to the experimental site to tune up the new detector array, operate, and bring home the data to analyze. When at the mine, we will all participate in the active outreach program consisting of daily public tours of the laboratory. <br/> While the Soudan science effort will consume about 80% of the resources supported by this grant, we intend to use the remaining resources to carry out detector R&D aimed at a proposed next-generation experiment called SuperCDMS. This will primarily involve cryogenic testing of new detectors being fabricated by our DoE-supported collaborators at Stanford that aim to have improved rejection of backgrounds and higher mass per detector module. Within this testing program, we plan to take advantage of opportunities in which streamlined detector packaging and simpler cold electronics can be simultaneously tested. <br/> We will also continue thin film tungsten studies that were initiated last year through undergraduate senior projects. This work aims to better understand the properties of the temperature-sensitive films that detect particle interactions in our detectors. At present, there is a variability problem that can be corrected but requires significant testing resources. The preparation of the films is carried out at minimal cost in a shared departmental facility and tested in our dilution refrigerator simultaneously with detector-testing runs. <br/> The final aspect of our R&D work is to begin development of a new assay technique to detect low-energy beta emitters, which represent a background tha can hamper progress on the experiment. Using a modest level of resources and undergraduate involvement, we can help lay the groundwork for rapid progress in the future. The efforts of our group will be highly leveraged by the presence of Prof. T. Shutt's group at Case and Prof. S. Golwala's group at Caltech. Shutt's group is developing low-activity MWPC elements for the XENON experiment similar to what's needed for the beta screener, and Golwala's group may be in a position to provide hardware for prototype construction."|0

Baryon physics can give a crucial contribution to improve the predictions of cosmological simulations. A key to understand galaxy form ation and evolution is to measure the baryonic content of galaxies: compared to the universal baryon fraction, it reveals if galaxies expel large amounts of the available baryons via stellar energy feedback. Disc galaxies are especially interesting because feedback is fundamental to explain their sizes and angular momenta. Also, the mass of baryons in discs is crucial to derive the density profiles of dark matter haloes, a puzzle for current cosmology. To know the mass of baryons in galaxies we must know th e mass-to-light (M/L) ratio of their luminous stellar component. Accurate data are available for the stellar populations in the Solar Neighbourhood, and we will interpret them with chemo-photometric models to derive the stellar M/L ratio in the local Galac tic Disc. We will then apply the models to external disc galaxies, and by combining chemo-photometric and dynamical analysis we will investigate the stellar M/L ratio as a function of Hubble type, of galaxy mass and in high vs. low surface brightness discs . We will infer how star formation and feedback work in different objects, so that we can include realistic baryon physics in cosmological simulations and improve our understanding of galaxy formation. Our chemical models will also predict the helium conte nt of nearby stars, and the relative helium-to-metal enrichment rate DY/DZ. We can also probe this quantity observationally, from the colour-magnitude diagram of a large sample of nearby low Main Sequence stars. From DY/DZ we can then infer the primordial helium abundance Yp, an important probe of cosmology and Big Bang nucleosynthesis.|0

This will result in the first definitive measurement of the large-scale clustering of quasars at redshifts beyond three, as a function of their luminosity and black hole mass. A survey of close quasar pairs at high redshift should determine whether these objects form in rare, high-density peaks, while targeted deep imaging will test for the frequency of such rare peaks, as well as for the existence of the predicted host clusters of galaxies. In addition, this study will make the first determination of the fraction of obscured quasars at high luminosities, and determine whether the census of high luminosity objects is close to complete.<br/><br/>The research supports a full-time graduate student, continuing a strong record of undergraduate and graduate training.

Weinberg Dr. Weinberg proposes to work with Dr. Katz (University of Massachusetts) and Dr. Hernquist (University of California, Santa Cruz) to conduct numerical simulations that model the cosmic history of the baryon component of the universe from z ~ 8 to the z=0, with particular attention to the Ly a forest, high redshift galaxies and the distributions of galaxies and intergalactic gas in the local universe. They plan to use TreeSPH - a numerical simulation code that combines a hierarchical tree N-body algorithm for gravitational components with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for the gas component. The code now exists in parallel form. According to the leading cosmological theories, the galaxies and large scale structure that we observe today grew by gravitational instability from small-amplitude fluctuations in the early universe. Gravitational clustering of collisionless dark matter drives the evolution of the mass distribution on large scales, but astronomical observations reply almost exclusively on electromagnetic radiation that has been emitted (or in some cases absorbed) by stars or gas. Hydrodynamic simulations, which incorporate the non-gravitational physics that influences the evolution of the cosmic baryon distribution, dramatically enhance the predictive and explanatory power of cosmological theories. Preliminary results from the simulations show that a substantial population of high redshift galaxies is predicted by several variants of the cold dark matter scenario. The team is studying the clustering of Lyman break galaxies in different scenarios. Hydrodynamic simulations show that the low column density Ly a forest arises primarily in diffuse, smoothly fluctuating, intergalactic gas. The physics of this medium is remarkably simple, allowing the simulations to make robust, quantitative predictions given a specified cosmological model. Simulations of high redshift structure, supported by QSO absorption data, indicate that most of t he high redshift baryons reside in the diffuse medium that produces the Ly a forest, with smaller fractions in galaxies and hot gas halos. ***|0

Comparison of the results of high resolution spectroscopy with hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of the high redshift (z ~ 3) universe have shown that the Lyman alpha forest is the observational signature of an extended ionized gas arranged in the shape of filaments and sheets, the ''Cosmic web'', from which galaxies condense. This main reservoir of baryons has properties which can be characterized by gas dynamics (temperature, pressure, ionization state) on a small scale; on larger scales the gas follows the distribution and peculiar motions of the dark matter which dominates the mass content of the universe. Observations of Lyman alpha absorption probe the ionization history and baryon density of the universe as well as the variations in the dark matter distribution which leads to the formation of structure in the universe. The funded work will continue and extend observations and analyses in a program of quasar absorption line studies and a program to detect emission from the Lyman alpha forest clouds using the HIRES and LRIS instruments on the Keck Telescopes.|0

The Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) framework addresses this challenge by describing galaxy bias at the level of virialized dark matter halos, principally via the probability that a halo of a specified mass contains a given number of galaxies of a specified class. This project includes theoretical and observational investigations that will further develop HOD methods and apply them to measurements from the SDSS. The theoretical work will reveal the effect of environmental variations on the HOD, such as a systematic dependence of the galaxy content of dark matter halos on the large scale density field. The observational work is a coherent analysis and interpretation of the final SDSS galaxy redshift survey, drawing on correlation functions, group multiplicities, redshift-space distortions, void probabilities, galaxy-galaxy lensing, group mass determinations, and the large scale galaxy power spectrum. This analysis will yield HOD determinations of many different classes of galaxies, and cosmological parameter constraints that are tighter and better tested than traditionally obtained. It will shed new light on galaxy formation, the physics of inflation, the matter content of the Universe, and the nature of dark energy. The project includes some work on cluster-galaxy lensing as a tool for probing the growth of fluctuations and the evolution of the cosmic distance scale.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator serves as Spokesperson for the SDSS, responsible for fostering the scientific interaction and productivity of the SDSS collaboration and for promoting the SDSS to the astronomical community and the general public. This research provides indirect but crucial support to such activities, thus enhancing the scientific return from the SDSS and its role in education and public outreach. The project also supports graduate student training and the public presentation of astronomy in various forums.|0

Grid computing can be viewed as a service for sharing computer power and data storage capacity over the Internet, simply and transparently, without having to consider where the computational facilities are located.<br/><br/>Experiments at major centralized experimental facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) require large amounts of computation and storage and involve hundreds of experimenters using computational facilities all over the world. These features are well suited to the capabilities of grid computing. Grid computing developments occurred in parallel to the development of the LHC experiments. The Open Science Grid (OSG) is the major facilitator of Grid Computing in the U.S. Researchers subsequently developed these ideas in many other exciting ways, producing for example, in addition to OSG, large-scale federated systems (TeraGrid, EGEE, Earth System Grid) that provide not just computing power, but also data and software on demand. Standards organizations then developed relevant standards that led to possible interoperability of Grids. Grids define and provide a set of standard protocols, middleware, toolkits, and services built on top of these protocols. Interoperability and security are the primary concerns for the Grid infrastructure as resources may come from different administrative domains, which have both global and local usage policies, different hardware and software configurations and platforms, and vary in availability and capacity.<br/><br/>The Open Science Grid is a distributed computing infrastructure for large-scale scientific research. The OSG contributes to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid as the shared distributed computing facility used by the US ATLAS and US CMS experiments. The OSG is built and operated by a consortium of 90 U.S. universities, national laboratories, scientific collaborations and software developers. It is supported by the National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy Office of Science. The OSG supports not only physics experiments but also researchers from other fields, including astrophysics, bioinformatics and computer science. Currently the OSG has more than 60 sites in the US and five sites in Brazil, Taiwan and Mexico, supported by the host countries.<br/><br/>All LHC computing and storage sites in the US are members of the OSG and allow other scientific collaborations using the OSG to opportunistically use available resources. The OSG collaborates with the Enabling Grids for E-sciencE project in Europe to provide interoperating federated infrastructures which can be used transparently by the LHC experiments' software. The Large Hadron Collider, located 330 feet below the border of Switzer¬land and France, is the world's most powerful particle accelerator. Its very-high-energy particle collisions may yield extraordinary discoveries about the nature of the physical universe. Beyond revealing a new world of unknown particles, the LHC experiments could explain why those particles exist and behave as they do. The LHC experiments could uncover the origins of mass, shed light on dark matter, expose hidden symmetries of the universe, and possibly find extra dimensions of space. <br/><br/>The LHC accelerates hair-thin beams of particles to a whisker below the speed of light. Thousands of powerful superconducting magnets steer the beams around the LHC's 16.5-mile-long ring. At four points the particles collide in the hearts of the main experiments, known by their acronyms: ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. In the data from these high-energy collisions scientists search for the tracks of particles whose existence could transform our understanding of the universe. More than 10,000 scientists, engineers and students from almost 60 nations on six continents contribute to the LHC, which is headquartered at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. About 1,700 come from universities and laboratories in the United States. Federal funding for US contributions to the LHC is provided by the US Department of Energy's Office of Science and the National Science Foundation.|0

Together with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, it would allow physicists to explore energy regions beyond the reach of today's accelerators. At these energies, researchers anticipate significant discoveries that will lead to a radically new understanding of what the universe is made of and how it works. The nature of the ILC's electron-positron collisions would give it the capability to answer compelling questions that discoveries at the LHC will raise, from the identity of dark matter to the existence of extra dimensions. <br/>In the ILC's design, two facing linear accelerators, each 20 kilometers long, hurl beams of electrons and positrons toward each other at nearly the speed of light. In the current design, each beam contains ten billion electrons or positrons compressed to a minuscule three-nanometer thickness. As the particles speed down the collider, superconducting accelerating cavities give them more and more energy. They meet in an intense crossfire of collisions. The energy of the ILC's beam can be adjusted to home in on processes of interest.<br/><br/>The ILC Global Design Effort (GDE) will establish the final configuration of the ILC, focusing the efforts of hundreds of accelerator scientists and particle physicists in North America, Europe and Asia.

XENON100, building upon the success of the XENON10 prototype, represents the current state-of-the-art in WIMP search detectors. With a realistic discovery potential, XENON100 has already reached a world-leading sensitivity, and continues to accrue data at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy towards its ultimate sensitivity reach. To fully probe a particularly favorable region of electroweak physics for WIMP dark matter in search of a first robust and statistically significant discovery, the next phase of the XENON program will be a detector at the ton scale - XENON1T. The worldwide race towards direct dark matter detection has been dramatically accelerated by the remarkable progress and evolution of LXeTPCs. They have shifted the scale of target mass from a few to tens of kilograms whilst simultaneously reducing both electronic and nuclear recoil backgrounds to extremely low levels. The XENON collaboration has demonstrated the effective scaling of LXeTPCs with phased detectors of increasing sensitivity of at least an order of magnitude, and is ready to move to the ton scale. <br/><br/>This award will provide funding to the US groups for the construction of the XENON1T detector, cryogenics infrastructure and calibration systems. This experiment is based on a TPC with 2.2 ton of LXe viewed by low radioactivity photomultiplier tubes. By exploiting the excellent self-shielding and 3D position resolution of a LXeTPC, by selecting existing low radioactivity detector materials and by placing the detector in a large active water shield and Cherenkov muon veto, the overall event rate within the fiducial target of 1.1 ton is estimated to be over a factor of 100 lower than the background measured in XENON100. This rate translates to less than one event per ton per year in the WIMP search region - an unprecedented low background level for a dark matter experiment.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The XENON scientific goal to detect the missing mass in the Universe has all the ingredients to captivate the interests and imagination of students and the general public alike. The technological advances of this project can impact society in a number of ways: liquid xenon imaging detectors and related technologies find applications in several fields outside particle astrophysics, including homeland security and medical imaging research.|0

The highest energy particles in Nature can now be studied in much greater detail and with higher statistics than ever before at the Pierre Auger Observatory.

Grossman plans to study different aspects of flavor physics. This includes traditional probes like B meson, D meson and K-meson physics, but also new ones, like top production and decays, and flavor aspects of physics beyond the standard model. Csaki and Perelstein plan to focus their attention on understanding the structure and signatures of models of electroweak symmetry breaking and of hierarchy stabilization, including supersymmetric, extra-dimensional and little Higgs models. Once the LHC experiments start, they expect to focus on theoretical interpretation of the data, with the ultimate goal of determining the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. They will also work on issues at the interface of particle physics and cosmology, aiming to understand the implications of the LHC data for cosmological questions such as the nature of dark matter and the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition. In string theory, McAllister and Tye propose to study certifications that result in stabilized moduli, and to use<br/>these setups to find realistic implementations of inflation in string theory. This provides a rigorous framework for resolving theoretical issues in inflation, and also provides the best prospect for experimental constraints on string theory. McAllister and Tye will pursue both aspects of this connection. Lepage proposes to use lattice simulations to finnd theoretical predictions for B and D meson physics observables at the few percent level, some of which will be compared to forthcoming results from CLEO-c. Kinoshita is proposing to calculate the eighth and tenth order QED contributions to the lepton g - 2,<br/>which will enable the most precise determination of the fine structure constant and also give the most stringent tests of QED. On the more formal side, LeClair is proposing to study quantum field theories in lower dimensions, with potential applications to condensed matter systems and string theory.

Nonetheless, many aspects of the Standard Model remain mysterious: What is the origin of the masses of the known elementary particles? What accounts for the hierarchical structure of their mass spectrum? Why is the gravitational force so much weaker than the electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear forces? What is the mysterious dark matter that seems to be pervasive in our universe? Professors Carone, Erlich, and Sher aim to address these and related questions by considering possible physics beyond the Standard Model, including new particles (for example, their proposed work on extended Higgs sectors), new symmetries (for example, their proposed work on models of neutrino masses), and new structures of space-time (for example, their proposed work on higher-dimensional models and holography). It is exciting that much of the work proposed by these principal investigators might be tested at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC, which is the highest energy proton-proton collider in the world, has begun full operations. Data from the LHC is imminent and is likely to lead to nothing less than a new Standard Model for the next generation of particle physicists, i.e., a new theoretical picture of the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions. In addition, the PIs have proposed work on dark matter, mysterious particles that will be studied not only at the LHC, but also at numerous direct detection experiments around the world. The PIs will consider possible models of a ""dark sector"", which may involve fairly light particles with very weak couplings to matter. To study such a sector experimentally, one requires high-intensity particle beams at low energies, and the PIs will consider how these models may be explored using the high-luminosity electron beam at Jefferson Lab. This effort may lead to new connections between the nuclear and high-energy physics communities.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professors Carone, Erlich, and Sher will involve graduate students and a postdoc in their research, providing critical training to junior physicists who are beginning research in this field.

Then it is expected that two-neutrino double beta decay of XE-136 will be observed for the first time and that, with the improved sensitivity for zero-neutrino decay, an electron neutrino mass limit around 0.01 eV may be reached. <br/><br/>This project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The U.S. researchers' expertise is in the area of small optical signals and the Japanese have the nuclear expertise in this area. A positive result for neutrinoless double beta decay would imply new physics beyond the Standard Model and may help explain astrophysical mysteries such as the solar neutrino and cosmic ray neutrino deficits and the composition of dark matter in the universe. This research advances international human resources through the participation of graduate students. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation. <br/>***|0

The researchers will be undertaking a study concerning the phenomenology of physics beyond the standard model. It is desirable to combine the phenomenological and theoretical expertise of the collaborators to make maximal progress on important research problems at the forefront of particle physics. They will be undertaking studies on the following models: 1) physics at linear e+e- colliders; <br/>2) Higgs boson physics; 3) supersymmetry and rand unified theories; 4) neutrino mass and oscillations; 5) astrophysics: neutrinos and SUSY dark matter; and 6) B physics. <br/><br/>This project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. Both groups are strong in electroweak phenomenology and grand unified theories (including supersymmetry). The research results are expected to be beneficial in advancing the understanding of basic particle physics questions at the forefront of the field.

This component is known as ""dark matter."" One of the outstanding problems in the construction of cosmological models is our lack of knowledge of just how the dark matter is distributed with respect to the luminous matter. The spatial function which can describe this difference in distribution is referred to as ""bias"" and its determination is critical for understanding the structure and evolution of the universe. The goal of this project is to construct a series of cosmological models, using a bias model known as the ""halo occupation distribution"" (HOD) which defines the bias of a population of galaxies by giving the conditional probability p(NjM) that a dark matter halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies, together with prescriptions that specify the relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within virialized dark halos. These models would predict different types of galaxy clustering depending on the HOD used. The resulting predicted distributions of galaxies generated by these families of cosmological models will be compared with the observed galaxy distributions found in the upcoming surveys from Australia (the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey or ""2dFGRS"") and from the United States (the Sloan Digital Sky Survey or ""SDSS""). These comparisons may confirm the basic validity of the models and thus determine an empirical form of the HOD. Alternatively, these empirical tests may show that the current theoretical picture of galaxy formation is still missing important physical ingredients.

This is due, in large part, to the fact that data is soon expected to emerge from a plethora of experiments in both particle physics and astrophysics. These include the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), experiments seeking the direct and indirect detection of Dark Matter, and Cosmic Microwave Background probes such as Planck. Indeed, in many instances these different experiments are complementary to each other, each providing a different window into the as-yet-unexplored physics beyond the Standard Model. In this proposal, Professor Tait aims to explore new theories for physics at the electroweak scale which sit at this interface between particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. His goal is to understand new phenomena which may be manifest at these experiments, provide theoretical descriptions of phenomena as they are discovered, and eventually fit them into a larger theoretical framework. Specific short-term goals of the PI include exploration of the signals provided by models with weakly bound states of dark matter at colliders and in cosmology, and exploration of signals of the so-called ""Beautiful Mirrors"" model at the LHC.<br/><br/>This effort is also envisioned to have several broader impacts. First, the PI will continue to participate in summer schools aimed at instructing graduate students working toward a PhD in theoretical or experimental high-energy physics. He will also compile a set of lecture notes which will be regularly updated, and include topics in the areas of collider physics and dark matter. These notes should provide an important resource for graduate students (or even postdocs and interested faculty in other subfields) in these rapidly evolving fields. Second, the PI plans outreach at the high-school level, to inform students (whose interests may lay outside the sciences) of the exciting advances taking place, and to encourage students to pursue a career in research."|0

Only 4% of the total energy of the Universe is made of baryons, the ordinary matter of which we, and stars, are made. A much larger fraction (22%) is a different kind of matter, which does not collapse into stars and does not shine - hence the term Dark Matter. Dark Matter, though, plays a very important role in the evolution of the Universe. It is subject to the gravitational force, and its presence has indeed allowed the formation of Galaxies. It is what ultimately keeps Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies together.<br/><br/>To date, it is not clear if Dark Matter interacts with the ordinary matter only through the gravitational force or also through other forces. However, particle physics offers an attractive solution in the form of relic neutral particles produced shortly after the Big Bang, pervading the cosmic space, and interacting weakly with ordinary matter. This class of Dark Matter candidates go under the name of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs).<br/><br/>The WARP (Wimp ARgon Program) was conceived to search for WIMP Dark Matter. WARP is capable of observing the extremely low energy signals produced by WIMP collisions with ordinary nuclei and, simultaneously, minimizing the signals from cosmic ray and natural radioactivity backgrounds that often limit observation of WIMP dark matter. WARP's two-phase drift chamber uses argon as a target. It has a unique capability that greatly enhances its sensitivity: it uses two fully independent techniques for discriminating minimum ionizing events from nuclear recoils. These rely on the subtle differences produced in the signals observed in WARP by the two different types of events.<br/><br/>The viability of the WARP experiment was well established with the successful operation of a small (3.8-kg) yet extremely sensitive prototype detector at the LNGS, the laboratory for astroparticle physics located underneath the peak of the Gran Sasso mountain in central Italy (1 hour by car from Rome) at a depth of 3,800 feet. The WARP collaboration will install in 2006 a much larger (140-kg) detector at LNGS which should improve the sensitivity by about two orders of magnitude for WIMP searches.<br/><br/>Education and Outreach are integral to the WARP effort. The PIs of the WARP Program are among the founders of the Gran Sasso-Princeton Summer School. Now in its second year, the School brings 20 promising high-school students from the Gran Sasso region to the Princeton University campus for an intensive 4-week program in physics. The School has become an instant success in Gran Sasso, with more than 300 applicants in 2005, and promises to become a lasting platform for the scientific and cultural enrichment of young Italian men and women. The school helps in establishing a strong link between the US and one of the prime laboratories for underground physics in the world, which hosts a number of US researchers and US funded efforts.<br/><br/>The WARP program will also offer in the forthcoming years an opportunity for a number of US students to get directly involved with the project both at Princeton and at LNGS. Research opportunities will include construction and testing of part of the experimental apparatus, and analysis of the data from the experiment. This hands-on experience will give the students a rare window into the nature of the experimental process that produces and tests the very knowledge that they find in their textbooks. The research experience on the project will build the student's confidence, expand their intellectual and cultural horizons, and, hopefully, inspire some to pursue degrees and even careers in science or engineering and to serve as role models for other young students.|0

Discovering the nature of this dark matter is one of the most important questions in physics and cosmology. Perhaps the most compelling idea is that dark matter is composed of subatomic particles known as weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs, that were created in the big bang. They most likely have a mass roughly the same as an atom of gold, but are effectively incredibly small and difficult to detect. Such particles are a generic prediction of supersymmetry, the best-motivated theory for particle physics at higher energy scales than has been probed so far in accelerators. Probing for supersymmetry is one of the principle goals for the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. <br/>If WIMPs do exist, they must also be the dominant mass in our galaxy, and should be detectable from interactions in detectors on Earth. The rate of these interactions can be roughly predicted from the same physics that governs their production in the big bang, and is unfortunately small: somewhere between roughly 1 event/kg/month and 1 event/ton/year. Ambient backgrounds in particle detectors, both from radioactivity and cosmic rays, are much larger than this. Current searches have only just achieved sensitivity to the highest of these possible rates.<br/>The XENON collaboration has developed a new generation of dark matter detector based on liquid xenon. Like the current leading detectors, this technology has the ability to distinguish most radioactive backgrounds (gamma rays and betas), which cause an electron to recoil after the detector is struck, from WIMPs, which cause a nucleus to recoil. However it promises to more readily be scaled to the ton-scale needed to fully test the WIMP hypothesis than the current leading detectors, which have a mass of roughly 1 kg. <br/>The work funded here is participation in the XENON10, a ~10 kg prototype experiment which will be located in Gran Sasso, Italy. Our group is developing a system for removal of radioactive Kr which contaminates Xe, and is also developing a new method for removing other impurities that degrade the performance of the detector. Our group will also be involved in the design and construction of the detector, in particular wire grids used to measure ionization produced by WIMPs, and work on a CsI system for measuring scintillation. Finally, we will be involved in data taking operations and analysis.<br/>The nature of dark matter is one the most important questions in physics and cosmology, and is of great interest to the public at large. Our group will be actively engaged in public outreach, especially with local schools. Education and training of both undergraduate and graduate students is fundamental to this work, and students will have major roles in the proposed research. The technical aspects of experimental physics are a good foundation for a wide range of careers that benefit the public good. The specific techniques of very low background particle detection also have an important national security role in nuclear non-proliferation verification. Our group has been actively engaged in a joint effort between academic physicists and physicists in the defense non-proliferation community to develop advanced next-generation low radioactive background screening facilities. This work will indirectly benefit this effort."|0

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. <br/><br/>One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. <br/><br/>But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>The achievements of particle physics during the last few decades have been enabled by the progress that has been made in the development and utilization of extremely sophisticated elementary particle detector technology, some of which has resulted in applications that have over time enjoyed spin offs into other areas of science. The primary goal of most of this technology is to reduce the level of noise in the detector to enable increasingly weaker signals to be observed. <br/><br/>There is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in liquid argon Time Projection Chambers (TPC) spurred in part by the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) project at Fermi National Acclerator Laboratory (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in general. This award supports the group of C. Bromberg at Michigan State University to work on the construction of a low noise readout system for the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) to be used in the LArIAT (Liquid Argon In A Test-beam) experiment at FNAL. The unique aspect of these electronics is that it uses cold preamplifiers, cooled by submerging them in Liquid Argon (87 degrees above absolute zero), that reduces electronic noise by 50% compared to room temperature electronics. FNAL is providing the test neutrino beam and associated detectors. This project will focus solely on the fabrication of the cold readout system.<br/><br/>LArTPC detector technology is scalable to the very large masses (perhaps 100kiloTons) needed by next generation neutrino experiments and is capable of recording three-dimensional digital images of particle trajectories. For these experiments systematic errors in the energy measurements are not well known. This project will help understand these errors and a crucial component will be the low-noise electronics.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this work involves training of an engineer in Liquid Argon technology. The PI also contributes to the US Particle Accelerator School using LAr TPCs as teaching tools.|1

The most well-known, and widely accepted solution to this problem is to embed the Standard Model in a super-symmetric theory. Such theories have been extensively studied in the past twenty years.

The equipment will be located at the Southern Methodist University (SMU) and at The Ohio State University (OSU) and will be used for the design and construction of readout electronics for the ATLAS experiment's liquid argon calorimeter and pixel detector. . ATLAS is one of two large-scale detectors being constructed for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. When the LHC turns on in 2007, it will be the premier particle physics facility in the world. The intellectual merit of this proposal is the advancement of our understanding of the laws of nature. The Higgs boson is the one essential ingredient in the standard model of particle physics that has yet to be discovered. The ATLAS experiment is designed both to discover the Higgs boson and to study its properties in detail. <br/><br/>While these fast, radiation resistant digital data links are being developed for ATLAS, fast data transfer via optical fibers has many applications. In high-energy physics experiments, it substantially reduces the volume of cables thereby freeing up valuable space as well as removing electrical ground loops. The wide bandwidth of opto-electronics is well suited for multiplexing input channels and allows for the introduction of error checking and error recovery transmission protocols. These features are especially important in the presence of radiation. Over the past several years, both the SMU and OSU groups have developed expertise in the design and fabrication of opto-electronics components. The SMU group has designed and constructed fast optical data links for the liquid argon calorimeter. The OSU group is the lead institution in the design and testing of the optical electronics for the pixel detector optical link and has developed radiation hard versions of the Digital Opto-Receiver Integrated Circuit and the Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers driver circuit. The equipment requested will allow the groups to broaden their expertise in opto-electronics as well as to strengthen their present and future contributions to the ATLAS experiment. <br/><br/>Among the broader impacts of this proposal are enhancing the infrastructure of the SMU and OSU groups; exciting and attracting a new generation of scientists; developing techniques and electronics that have applications beyond HEP; disseminating the information learned in this project to the scientific and business community, and providing an example to society of a collaborative effort that crosses geographic and cultural boundaries.|1

This will present a big challenge for the whole high energy physics community, both on the experimental and the theoretical side. A huge amount of data will need to be processed, analyzed and then compared with theoretical models and predictions. On the one hand the LHC will test in depth the current Standard Model (SM) of particle physics and search for the last missing particle predicted in the model, the Higgs boson. On the other hand, LHC will give particle physicists the possibility to explore the TeV energy scale for the first time and it will hopefully bring evidence for new phenomena that are not incorporated in the SM. The main objective of the research work presented in this proposal is the development of new theoretical tools for the calculation of multi-particle NLO scattering amplitudes, as well as the direct computation of theoretical predictions for scattering processes necessary for the interpretation of the results at the LHC. For the last two years, the PI has been working on the problem of calculating one-loop scattering amplitudes efficiently. A new method, known as OPP-reduction, has been developed. The PI will use the innovative OPP-method to compute theoretical predictions for processes of interest at the LHC. The PI will also optimize the existing numerical codes used to perform the calculations, in order to improve their efficiency and flexibility. He then hopes to automate the whole process for one-loop computations.<br/>The broader impacts are many. As a discovery machine, LHC will have a strong impact on the media. The PI will organize public presentations, not only directed to science major but to the broader community. A first presentation will explain the main features of the LHC and the challenges of the current models in particle physics and cosmology. A second presentation, ideally during the second year of activity of the LHC, will give an update on the scientific progress, at a very general level. The New York City College of Technology (CUNY) plays a leading role in the education of minorities underrepresented in the sciences and engineering. The PI will provide high-quality teaching, resources, and possibilities for students to participate in the scientific enterprise, where they can contribute with the technical skills that they developed during their studies.|1

Most of the matter of the universe (the ""dark matter"", solidly established by astronomical and cosmological observations) consists of something undiscovered, and thus there must exist new particles not in the Standard Model. Additionally, the presence of the Higgs boson and the expected properties of a quantum field theory together suggest that new particles and fields will be discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, because the properties of both of these new sets of particles are unknown, a broad theoretical study is required in order to evaluate what possible new particles might be discoverable with present techniques and what new search strategies might be needed. As part of this project, Professor Weiner intends to investigate a broad range of theoretical scenarios, both top-down (motivated by new and existing theoretical scenarios) and bottom-up (motivated by new signatures) as well as their experimental implications for the LHC and for direct-detection experiments. Additionally, Professor Weiner will pursue studies to understand the sensitivities of dark-matter searches, with a focus on the sensitivities of the astrophysical assumptions present in the existing analyses.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project will be wide ranging. Professor Weiner will involve both students and postdocs in his research program, providing opportunities to train future scientists. He will also continue his participation in physics summer schools (as invited), such as the TASI, CLASHEP, ICTP and Les Houches programs, to educate current PhD students on active research topics. Finally, he will continue his efforts to engage the public through public lectures as well as his outreach at the high-school level, anchored by his continued participation with the Governor's School summer program in North Carolina."|1

Run 2 will provide a new era of exploration and potential discovery at the energy frontier. The expanded capabilities of the detectors and the accelerator will allow the direct study of one of the most pressing issues in all of particle physics: the origin of mass. Within the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs field provides a means of generating particle masses and spontaneously breaking the symmetry of the electroweak interaction. Precision measurements performed over the last decade have confirmed that something akin to the Standard Model process of mass generation must exist, but the Higgs boson, the physical manifestation of the Higgs field, has yet to be observed. Seeing it and measuring its properties would be an important step in our understanding of the fundamental structure of nature and should point the way toward a larger theory of which the Standard Model is only a part. Achieving the ambitious goal of discovering the Higgs boson is currently only possible at the Tevatron, provided that the amount of data delivered to the experiments is increased by an order of magnitude over that originally anticipated for the current run. This requires larger interaction rates resulting in increased detector backgrounds, and will force the experiment to be far more selective in the events written to permanent storage for analysis. <br/><br/>Additionally, funds are requested for a new initiative that would involve Columbia liberal arts students in the important dialog between scientists and the general public through a summer internship with the Fermilab public relations department. Education and outreach activities also include training the next generation of physicists through participation of graduate and undergraduate students in research projects. Just as importantly, though, it also involves strengthening the understanding of current research by the general public. This latter goal can best be achieved by involving non-scientists in the process. Among the enthusiastic and articulate group of students in the ""Physics for Poets"" class the PI teaches at Columbia, there is an excellent source of people who are interested in science but approach it from a liberal arts background. He proposes to take advantage of the unique perspective of these students by creating an internship to involve several students per year in the outreach work done at Fermilab."|1

The Principal Investigator proposes a program that will produce new measurements of the properties of these heavy quarks. Such measurements will undoubtedly lead to an improved understanding of nature at its most fundamental level. Although the physics program emphasizes precision measurements of the heavy quarks, the work performed as part of this project will be crucial to many aspects of the CDF physics program, including the search for the Higgs boson and new physics through Supersymmetry. Specifically, the PI proposes to construct an upgrade to the CDF trigger system, referred to as the eXtremely Fast Tracker (XFT), which will improve the experiment's ability to select which events to keep for subsequent analysis by efficiently finding the charged tracks produced in every proton-antiproton interaction. Charged track information is crucial to the CDF physics program and hundreds of different physics analyses rely heavily upon the very efficient operation of the XFT system. <br/><br/>The PI proposes to expand the existing physics outreach program at the University of Illinois, known as the Saturday Physics Honors Program. This program provides physics presentations for the public during selected Saturdays in the fall. The production of DVD copies of the lectures, and the distribution to high school teachers, will provide an opportunity for students across the state to view and learn about cutting edge research and will permit a direct connection between research physicists and high school science teachers.|1

It will partially support the salary and the tuition of graduate students to work on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It will also support a part time staff (undergraduate student) for the new outreach program he has initiated at the University. His research at CMS is focused on the search for the Higgs boson through its decay into two photons, its most likely discovery mode at the LHC. He also proposes to use the techniques needed for the Higgs discovery to search for signs of new physics, including manifestations of hidden valleys, supersymmetry, and new strong dynamics. It is expected his experience at D0 should enable him to take a leading role in such searches. In coordination with the New Jersey Chapter of the American Association of Physics Teachers, he is initiating a ""Saturday Morning Physics"" program of lectures at Rutgers University on the cutting edge developments in science and technology. It will target high school students from under-represented urban areas such as Camden, Newark, New Brunswick, and Trenton, aiming to improve their perception of science and inspire some to pursue careers in engineering or science. Students who attend the lectures would be tracked in an attempt to understand whether this increases the fraction that pursue science in college. An undergraduate student will aid in this effort. In addition, he plans to hold seminars following these lectures targeted to high school teachers. In order to better evaluate and enhance the effectiveness of this program, and to help implement the material into the actual lesson plans, the PI plans to closely involve high school teachers and pre-service teachers. These lesson plans would be posted on a web site - creating a resource for teachers not able to attend the lecture/seminars. Working with the Graduate School of Education and the NJ Department of Education a further goal is for teachers to earn developmental credit for the lesson plans evolving from the lectures and other projects such as QuarkNet activities."|1

This program will cover searches for the Higgs boson(s) at both the Tevatron Collider at Fermilab and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. In particular, the search will be focused on a Higgs decaying into a pair of tau-leptons. The tau -channels offer a clean signature with reduced backgrounds, and are central to the search for all types of Higgs particles such as those deriving from Standard Model, light neutral Supersymmetric, heavy neutral Supersymmetric, charged Supersymmetric theories. Transfer of the expertise from the Tevatron to the LHC will be critical for the success of the Higgs research program of the CMS experiment at the LHC. This proposal will help start a tau -lepton effort within the US part of the CMS Collaboration. Discovering the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of mass constitutes one of the most important open questions and highest priorities in particle physics today. Fermilab Tevatron and the CERN LHC hadron colliders offer unique discovery opportunities in that front. The PI's research in the last several years has been focused on the quest for the Higgs boson; the signature particle for the prevailing mechanism proposed to explain electroweak symmetry breaking and therefore, brings extensive expertise to the program. <br/><br/>The educational and outreach goals are to engage non-traditional participants, namely female high school teachers and students in particle physics research at the scientific frontier, in the hope to infuse these very young women with a love for physics and science in general.

This CAREER program led by Prof Dmitri Tsybychev is focused on the ATLAS experiment and there are three aspects. The first is the study of events containing W + Jets and W + Jets + missing ET in the final state with the objective of measuring the cross section for WL WL scattering at high mass. In the absence of some control at the electroweak scale this cross section becomes unbounded. The Higgs boson is a means to control this, but there may be other new physics at play. The challenge is that the WW cross section is very small and hence high energy and high luminosity are both required. The second aspect of the program is focuses on the upgrade of the ATLAS vertex detectors. At the very high interaction rates expected at the LHC, the highest resolution elements of the inner detector (in this case pixel layers) are fundamental to identifying and disentangling collision vertices, identification of decay vertices of long-lived particles and for the tracking of charged particles. The Tsybychev group is involved in the R&D, design and construction of 3D pixel sensors ? a novel, powerful, and potentially robust technology for inner tracking. The third aspect is the participation of this group in the broader aspects of the MARIACHI project based at Brookhaven National Laboratory and SUNY Stony Brook.

The PI, Julia Thom of the Department of Physics at Cornell University, will lead a program to develop silicon pixel detectors for the Compact Muon Spectrometer at the upgraded Large Hadron Collider (Super-LHC) at CERN. The research goal to understand the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking relies on the precise measurement of charged particle trajectories provided by silicon pixel detectors. In the Standard Model of elementary particle physics, electroweak symmetry breaking is associated with the existence of a Higgs particle which has yet to be discovered. While the discovery of the Higgs Boson is most likely to occur at the standard LHC, the increased luminosity at the Super-LHC will provide the statistical power to study its properties in detail. The discovery of the Higgs particle and the measurement of its quantum numbers are of utmost importance in particle physics today. The proposed program includes design, simulation and testing of cutting-edge pixel sensor technology that can withstand the extremely high radiation doses and tracking densities at the Super-LHC. This work will be carried out in collaboration with researchers at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and partners in industry. Based at Cornell University in upstate New York, the PI has learned that there are no regular science education programs that target schools in surrounding poor rural communities. In particular, the number of girls in this region pursuing higher education in science or engineering is alarmingly low. The proposal includes initiating a program that provides mentoring and science summer camps for girls, teacher workshops, and regular visits to six schools that have been classified as high-need and that show particular interest in this program. The program will be implemented in collaboration with a professional educator, whose research interest in science education in rural poverty settings matches the goals of the PI.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The development of a new silicon pixel detector is essential to take advantage of the luminosity upgrade of the LHC for detailed studies of many of the new and possibly revolutionizing phenomena that are expected at the TeV energy scale. Since no known technology can withstand the enormous particle rates expected at the Super-LHC, the development of innovative silicon pixel detector technology built on the recent progress of the silicon processing industry would be a breakthrough in the field of particle detection. If successful, this development would have many important applications in x-ray imaging for biology and astrophysics.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The research project requires an extensive collaboration between the Fermi<br/>National Accelerator Laboratory, the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell, and partners in industry. The project provides an opportunity to provide graduate and undergraduate students with the experience of interdisciplinary research at the cutting-edge of pixel detector technology. The science education program would encourage girls in underserved rural areas to pursue careers in science and engineering, serve as a tool for the professional development of teachers, and bring the excitement of science to the broader community.|1

Thesae are some of the most important outstanding questions in particle physics. The discovery of Higgs bosons and measurements of their properties would shed light on these historic questions. It may be possible to discover a light Higgs at the Fermilab Tevatron if models such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) are considered. MSSM predicts Higgs production cross sections one to several orders of magnitude larger than those of the standard model. Near the end of Run II, with integrated luminosities of less than 4 fb-1, it could be possible to discover Higgs bosons at moderately large values. In addition, the combined results of CDF and D0's standard model Higgs search would close the search window on Higgs masses up to 125 GeV, a mass region that will be difficult to explore at the LHC. These physics and tracking studies will bridge the gap between the Tevatron and the LHC. Precision silicon detectors have played an historic role in the search for the Higgs boson and the PI has a long experience with building and optimizing the performance of such devices and using them to set the world's best limits on the mass of the Higgs. This work will continue with the construction of the CMS forward pixel detector and the construction of a small lab for future R&D into silicon detectors. <br/><br/>The education and outreach part of this proposal seeks out high achieving bi-lingual (Spanish-English) high school students and pairs them with mostly Latino elementary school students who are tutored two afternoons per week.

In its first run, the D0 experiment has<br/>produced results on the discovery of the top quark, a measurement of its mass, precise measurements of standard model parameters such as the mass of the W boson, and new constraints on phenomena beyond the standard model.<br/>With the upgraded Tevatron collider, the D0 experiment is expected to study further the properties of the electroweak force and the top quark. Thousands of top quarks are expected to be produced in a search for new particles in its decay and new forces in its production. There will be direct searches for the Higgs boson and other signatures of electroweak symmetry breaking. The key experimental signature of these processes is the presence of b quarks, which are sufficiently long-lived and sufficiently energetic on average to travel a few millimeters from the primary collision point before they decay.<br/>The proposers intend to design and build a fast processor to identify hit patterns consistent with charged particles from the slightly displaced secondary vertex characteristic of a b-quark decay. This must be accomplished in approximately 50 microseconds while the data are being read out of the detector. To achieve the required speed, the device will employ highly parallel processing of the data from the silicon microstrip tracker. It will allow efficient isolation of the relatively rare signal events from the much more copious background. Detecting such secondary vertices during detector readout would be a new advance for experimental high energy physics. It opens dramatic new possibilities for selecting events with heavy quarks.|1

It is the only particle predicted by the highly successful Standard Model, which has yet to be found experimentally.The discovery of this last missing particle is of utmost importance for particle physics as it will allow for a full test of the Standard Model, and give an answer to the origin of mass.The two main important fields to be studied for an eventual discovery of the Higgs boson are further constraints on the allowed mass of the Higgs boson through electroweak radiative corrections on other particles and a search for its direct production.A precise measurement of the W boson mass together with a detailed knowledge of the mass of the top quark is sensitive to the Higgs boson mass. Extrapolating the current performance of the Tevatron Collider, it will be possible for CDF to measure the W boson mass to +-25 MeV.This will by itself be the most accurate measurement in the world. Together with an anticipated precision of +-2 GeV of the to p quark mass it will be possible to predict the mass of the Higgs boson to a relative error of 30%, thus substantially narrowing down the search window.The Higgs decay modes depend on the Higgs mass and so this constraint will determine the Higgs search strategy. The direct search for the Higgs boson will give one important and exciting intermediate step. Top quarks can be produced not only in pairs (as they were discovered in 1995) but also singly through an electroweak vertex.This production mode has so far not been discovered due to a smaller production probability. In its final state, this process is identical to a Higgs boson decay into two bottom quarks produced together with a W boson.Since the expected production probability for Higgs bosons is an order of magnitude smaller compared to the singly produced top quarks means that having the expertise to find single top production is an essential milestone to be able to discover the Higgs boson.|1

CTEQ is a collaboration dedicated to the effects of the strong interaction on phenomenological processes at colliders. These effects are crucial in extracting results from most collider experiments. For example, understanding the properties of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) requires understanding its production in proton-proton collisions, and that requires understanding how quarks, antiquarks and gluons fit inside of protons. It is this understanding that the CTEQ Collaboration provides. Understanding Higgs decays to quarks also depends on this knowledge. The results of the CTEQ Collaboration are essential in both experimental and theoretical particle physics and are heavily used. The Summer Schools operated by CTEQ are a training ground for numerous physicists to continue the Collaboration. They are truly international - the 2014 School is in Beijing and the 2015 School is in Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>Over 1000 physicists have attended the CTEQ Schools, which consist of nine days of lectures and discussion. Each school has 50-100 students attending. The impact on the field is profound, and many collaborations have been generated by this close interaction. Every year, many students claim a financial hardship in attending, and receive fellowships. This award will go to support students in attending the Schools.

This facility is at the energy frontier of experimental particle physics. The primary goal of the experiment is to search for the Higgs boson, the physical manifestation of the Higgs field. Within the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs field provides a means of generating the particle masses and spontaneously breaking the symmetry of the electroweak interaction. There are many indications that the Tevatron collider could produce the Higgs boson, provided that enough antiproton-proton collisions are delivered to the experiments. <br/><br/>The planned luminosity upgrade of the Tevatron will require the experiments to be even more selective than in the past and thus an efficient trigger system is essential. Selection algorithms giving background rejection factors of more than 105 with high efficiency must be implemented in real time. This proposal would support the development of the hardware and algorithms necessary for the D0 experiment to cope with the higher interaction rates produced at the upgraded luminosities.|1

The top quark is the most massive fundamental particle that has ever been discovered: it has many unique properties and may be crucial to understanding the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking. For these reasons, the top quark was the centerpiece of the physics program at the Tevatron collider at Fermilab, and it is now a central part of the physics program at the LHC. Similarly, the Higgs boson is the particle thought to be responsible for mass generation and its discovery is also a priority for the LHC. As part of this project, Professor Kidonakis will improve theoretical predictions for top-quark production in top-antitop and single-top channels as well as for Higgs production and other processes. He will do this by performing state-of-the-art calculations of higher-order corrections. These calculations will ultimately be important for understanding the implications of upcoming LHC data.<br/><br/>This work is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The proposed research is very timely since it addresses physics that is relevant to the LHC. The research findings will also be widely disseminated through publication in refereed journals and presentations in international conferences and workshops. Finally, this project will strengthen the educational and research programs at Kennesaw State University. Professor Kidonakis has actively involved undergraduate and graduate students in his research, and this project offers numerous research and educational opportunities for student involvement.|1

To recruit young minds at an early age (K-12) into the workforce and to encourage governments to continue investment, the parallel computing field must constantly educate non-computer scientists of all ages as to the importance of innovation that uncovers and exploits new capabilities. Unfortunately, educating laypersons as to the importance of parallel systems that grow exponentially large and complicated and change rapidly is wrought with challenges. Distribution of data and computation across a large parallel or distributed system is carried out by complex computer software. While the algorithms and systems used may have taken years to perfect, other than binary data packets and logs, and perhaps the hum of a system, there is little indication of the transmissions. Only a deeply informed individual is privy to the significance of the events taking place on a large parallel or distributed system.<br/><br/>In this interdisciplinary project, the PIs are exploring radically different ways to improve our ability to educate non-computer scientists (e.g. students, K-12, funding decision makers, elderly, etc.) as to the importance and sophistication of parallel computation. This transformative approach combines the creation of a parallel or distributed system with mechanisms to visualize computation. With the combined expertise of computer scientists, educators, and artists, the PIs are designing and building a cluster of Raspberry Pi computers in a visually compelling, kinetic sculpture. Each computing device is attached to a compact servo mechanism fitted to an aluminum structure that will react to both computation and data movement of parallel programs running on the system. The PIs are designing displays that allow visitors to the sculpture to interactively select and view the effects of various parallel computation choices that computer and computational scientists make every day. The effectiveness of the proposed approach will be evaluated.|1

The SM successfully describes all presently observed electroweak and strong interactions of matter particles (quarks and leptons) and of the mediators of the fundamental forces (photon, W and Z bosons, and the gluon). However, due to apparent shortcomings of the SM (e.g., hierarchy problem, fine tuning, absence of gauge-coupling unification at high energies), it is commonly believed that it is merely the low-energy limit of a more fundamental theory, which has additional symmetries such as Supersymmetry (SUSY), an additional symmetry that connects fermions and bosons or which has extra spatial dimensions. The main goal of present and future collider experiments is to further test the SM and to detect signals of new physics, either directly (through the production of non-SM particles), or indirectly (as small deviations from the predicted properties of SM particles).<br/>The PIs propose to investigate possible deviations from the SM in the interactions of top quarks and Higgs bosons, and to develop improved theoretical calculations and computational tools which are needed to perform precision studies of SM and SUSY particles at the Fermilab Tevatron, the CERN Large Hadron collider (LHC), and a future International e+e&#8722; Linear Collider (ILC). In order to extract precise physics information from these experiments, theoretical predictions must match or exceed the experimental accuracy.

The goal is to engage the full educational spectrum from high school students, high school teachers, undergraduates and the general public in understanding and doing high energy physics. The activities range from individual faculty outreach efforts, such as lectures, tours, and research involvement with high school students, to structured programs like the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU).

The electromagnetic and weak interactions, though unified in phenomena at high energies and in the first moments after the Big Bang, appear at lower energies to be quite distinct. The Standard Model of fundamental interactions and constituents of matter builds in this symmetry breaking through the Higgs boson. One strand of the proposed research is the search for the Higgs boson. Another strand of the proposed studies seeks evidence for phenomena that will show how the Standard Model is modified, and help illuminate the more comprehensive theory. These aspects of symmetry breaking will be explored through work in the D0 (at Fermilab) and ATLAS (at CERN) experiments. The proposal also outlines a new participation in the KOPIO experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory, aimed at the measurement of a rare neutral kaon decay (to a neutral pion, neutrino and anti-neutrino). This would not occur unless there were a lack of symmetry between our world and one in which particles are replaced by antiparticles and viewed in a mirror (CP symmetry). The observation of a deviation from the value predicted by the Standard Model will signal that new non-standard mechanisms are at play in CP-violation, and should aid in understanding the origin of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the research will occur at several levels: (a) Understanding how matter is constructed and how the forces of nature shape it into the myriad observed forms is a long standing question that resonates with scientists and non-scientists alike; (b) The research program poses a set of questions through which students and postdoctoral fellows will learn not only to frame crisp tests of the fundamental construction of matter, but also to devise innovative methods and tools for conducting them. Attacking such problems provides the rigorously educated young people that our society desperately needs; and (c) the proposal includes elements of outreach to the broader community.|1

The major effort will be with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, where the group will continue support for the calorimeters with an emphasis on measuring electrons, photons, missing energy and long lived-particles that enable studies of W/Z bosons in association with heavy quarks.

According to that theory, protons and neutrons, along with all other strongly interacting particles, are composed of even more fundamental particles called partons (quarks and gluons). Interactions between the partons are described by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The proposed research involves continued refinement in understanding the interplay between QCD theory and experiment, which is necessary to deepen the understanding of QCD and to determine the probability distributions of the partons in the proton by global analysis. The resulting CTEQ Parton Distributions are essential to the interpretation of experiments at the world's leading high energy collider facilities: Fermilab (Batavia, IL), DESY (Hamburg, Germany), RHIC (Brookhaven, NY), and CERN (Geneva, Switzerland). The Electroweak sector of the SM is extremely successful in explaining and predicting experimental data spanning a range in energy from the atomic scale to the Z boson mass.<br/>However, one major aspect of the model remains to be elucidated: the mechanism of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB), which generates masses for the W and Z bosons while leaving electromagnetic gauge symmetry intact. In the SM, EWSB is economically implemented through a single scalar particle called the Higgs boson. However, the SM cannot explain observations such as the hierarchical pattern of fermion masses, or the existence of dark matter; so it is widely believed that new measurements at very high energies, or very high precision, will soon turn up deviations from the SM that will point to new physics.<br/><br/>A second part of the project represents continuation of research to probe the EWSB mechanism in high energy collisions. Special consideration is given to measuring the couplings of the top quark to W and Z gauge bosons and to (elementary or composite) Higgs boson(s); and to searching for the Higgs boson and determining its properties. These are prime objectives of experiments at the Fermilab Tevatron collider and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are as follows: The achievement of the project will contribute to understanding of the fundamental interactions in Nature. The project trains graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in theoretical high energy physics at MSU and at the CTEQ summer schools. It also provides opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in research through the REU program, and for high school teachers and middle school students to experience forefront research through Summer programs sponsored by MSU and the State of Michigan.|1

Even if a neutral Higgs boson is discovered, a crucial question will remain still open: It is the Higgs particle of the Standard Model or, contrary, there is an extended Higgs structure Beyond the Standard Model.

The new technique, boosted jet algorithms, is a way of discovering the properties of primary quarks decaying from new particles such as the Higgs boson. The signature of quarks from a primary interaction in CMS is the formation of a large number of detected particles all flowing in approximately the same direction. This formation is known as a jet. Extracting jets from background and measuring the energy and precise direction of a jet requires sophisticated algorithms such as the boosted jet algorithm that will be used here. These quarks are difficult to detect because they are hidden in a background of particles coming from uninteresting decays, the so-called pile-up background. The quark jets of interest here are coming from the decay of new particles such as the Higgs boson and other as-yet undiscovered, but theoretically proposed, particles that decay to highly boosted (high kinetic energy) top quarks and di-boson resonances (WW, ZZ and WZ). The boosted jet algorithm and other related techniques are showing great promise in identifying boosted jets in the presence of high background and are being used productively in the analysis of CMS data.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this work involves extending the coverage of the current outreach program at the University of Buffalo (UB) to engage the broader public in discussions of major results in particle physics, as well as to enliven particle physics for young students.

In 2012 the LHC has led to the discovery of the Higgs boson, the only particle in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics that had not been observed previously. After this final triumph of the SM, the primary mission of the LHC will be to look for new physics beyond the SM. The existence of such new physics within the reach of the LHC is motivated by several observations which cannot be explained within the SM, but which point to the distance scales that are being explored at the LHC. The existence of Dark Matter (DM) in the universe with the correct properties is an example of this. In light of the fact that no clear signs of such new physics have been observed so far, the possibility needs to be considered that the new particles in question may be difficult to discover, either because they are rarely produced, or because their experimental signatures can be easily mistaken for those of known particles present in the SM. The results of the LHC searches for new physics will define the path of high energy physics in the future, which makes it essential that all efforts be made to maximize the discovery potential. Professor Kilic's research project will address how further optimization for discovery and higher precision for measurements can be obtained in the challenging scenarios mentioned above. <br/><br/>There are also several broader impacts of the research described in this project.

The new muon detectors will improve the momentum resolution of the spectrometer significantly. This detector upgrade is crucial for the search for new particle like the Higgs boson, sypersymmetric particles and additional heavy Z bosons. The EE chambers will be produced in IHEP, Protvino. The first step includes the chamber design, drift tube production, chamber glueing, assembly of gas connections and testing. In order to achieve an improved momentum resolution not only precise EE muon chambers are required but also the alignment of the chambers needs to be known with a precision better than 50 µm. This is achieved with special alignment bars, which support optical sensors. From their readings and the knowledge of the 3 dimensional positions of all sensors on the bar one can reconstruct the alignment of all muon chambers. The alignment bars will be produced and measured in Freiburg. The final chamber testing and the integration of chambers, bars and support structures will be done at CERN. An important and difficult task is the design and planning of the installation procedure of these chambers. Because they are added into the existing first phase ATLAS detector, special tooling has to be designed to fit them into the existing structures. The Weizmann group is mainly responsible for this task. The aim of this project is to produce and test 64 EE MDT chambers and 32 alignment bars and the tooling such that they are ready for installation. The installation itself will be done by the ATLAS technical coordination. The exact time of installation will depend on the schedule of shut-downs of the LHC operation.|1

The mystery can be cast in another way: why is gravity so much weaker than the other Standard Model forces? This award funds research on the characteristics of gravity at sub-millimeter distances to be conducted through the use of cryogenic micro-cantilever beams which allow measurements of gravitational forces at sub-100 micron length scales at the atto-Newton level. The force sensitivity of these micro-cantilever experiments is limited by mechanical dissipation. To mitigate this mechanical loss, we will develop a novel apparatus to trap and cool dielectric nanospheres using lasers. By optically levitating the force sensor, an exquisite decoupling from the environment is possible.<br/><br/>Studies such as ours could lead to exciting new discoveries of physics beyond the Standard Model which has recently been famously validated by the detection of what appears to be the Higgs boson. Our research program is at the forefront of current knowledge and enhances the scientific competency of the state of Nevada, which is currently under-represented in terms of scientific endeavor. Additional efforts are undertaken to bring this exciting research to the general university population through a series of scheduled lectures for incoming college freshmen interested in the sciences. Also, public lectures are presented to encourage young people in Nevada to pursue career in science.|1

In collaboration with University of Oklahoma, State University of New York at Albany, and Susquehanna University, the project spans four geographically dispersed institutions. The acquisition targets a cost-effective high-resolution tiled display system providing a collaborative visualization environment. This visualization system will be constructed as a tiled display wall (16- foot wide by 4.6-foot tall) over an area that fills a user?s field of view to provide a display that looks nearly borderless. It will be connected to several Tier-4 data analyses workstations via a wall processor, so that the scientists can simultaneously display multiple ATLAS data events all at once. 2D and 3D visualization tasks will be carried out using Atlantis, GraXML and VP1 visualization software package. The studies and research projects in high energy physics will be enabled, including, but not limited, to the research for new types of subatomic particles, such as the charged Higgs boson and Supersymmetric (SUSY) particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and ?Search for Charged Higgs Boson from tt Production?. <br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>This instrumentation increases institutional capacity to conduct cutting-edge research in cost-effective visualization system. Since the large amount of data cannot be otherwise analyzed and studied, visualization is fundamental for high energy physics. The acquisition of this visualization system should significantly increase the research capability within all the participating institutions. Moreover, the acquisition of this visualization system will serve as a campus-wide resource and provide an exceptional opportunity to engage students in research at the forefront of data-intensive computational science, visualization, and high-energy physics.

The collaborative research activities will be carried out in close partnership with University of Oklahoma, State University of New York at Albany, Purdue University at Calumet, Southwestern University, and a Historically Black Minority-Serving institution, Benedict College. Using the grid middleware resources, this partnership will essentially create a virtual organization that will link all the research participants by bringing together geographically and organizationally dispersed computational resources and people from the six institutions from six different states by developing a platform for shared systematic use of the supercomputing cluster and effective utilization of computational tools. We plan to search for the Higgs Boson and SUSY (Supersymmetric) particles in specific decay channels using the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) data. The physics studies will first be carried out and tested on detailed simulations of particles and their interactions with the detector using the GEANT monte-carlo package.

The computational research activities with OSG will not only have a significant and a broad societal impact on the educational training of undergraduate students of all races and ethnicity at Bellarmine University, but also has the potential to bring in a new era of grid-enabled scientific research capability at this institution via infusion of this new knowledge. The grid-enabled supercomputing cluster will create precisely the kind of exciting learning environment that will provide the next generation of students at all seven participating institutions with an accessible entry to research and education at the frontiers of computational science, information technology, and cluster/grid computing. These trained students will acquire a solid computational background with broad technical skills and expertise in high performance parallel cluster computing techniques and grid middleware technologies.

The Tevatron collider is currently the only facility in the world capable of making a Higgs discovery. Simulation studies have shown that the two Tevatron collider experiments, CDF and D0, are sensitive to the Higgs over almost all its presently allowed mass range. Furthermore, there is some evidence from the recently decommissioned LEP electron-positron collider at CERN for a light Higgs (~115 GeV) in the region where the Fermilab experiments have their greatest sensitivity.<br/><br/>A key element in the Higgs search is the ability to detect the b-quarks from Higgs decay. The b-quark lifetime is sufficiently long (~1.5 picoseconds) that it can be identified by a Silicon Vertex Detector that precisely measures charged particle tracks. The current D0 silicon detector was designed well before the potential for making a Higgs discovery was appreciated and is not sufficiently radiation-hard for the Higgs search. Thus, the D0 collaboration has embarked on designing a new Silicon Vertex Detector that is specifically optimized for the Higgs search, to be installed by 2004 when the performance of the current vertex detector will have been diminished by radiation damage.<br/><br/>With this MRI proposal, a consortium of eight university groups, five of which are currently supported by the NSF for their D0 work, propose to develop, procure, assemble, and test the silicon sensor assemblies for five of the six layers that will be built. These assemblies are the active elements that make the charged track measurements and constitute a major contribution to the detector. The development of this new silicon vertex detector would be a joint development project between university groups and Fermilab. Much of the intellectual and technical leadership for this effort originates in the university groups. NSF support will bring strong intellectual and technical input to the project through the design, fabrication, and testing of detector components by university faculty and students working closely together at their home institutions.|1

The FTK will perform global track recognition reconstruction using the innovative technique of massive parallelism. A billion track patterns are pre-stored in custom content-addressable memory (Associative Memory) chips that are being designed. As each hit leaves the detector at full speed, it is simultaneously seen by all patterns. Track fitting is replaced by a linear calculation of the track parameters and the goodness of fit, with nearly offline resolution. With modern electronics, one can fit tracks at a rate of one track per nanosecond. <br/><br/>For the next decade, experiments at the LHC will provide unprecedented opportunities for answering the most important questions in elementary particle physics. Data collected by ATLAS will be used for hundreds of simultaneous analyses to search for the Higgs boson, supersymmetry, large extra dimensions, dark matter, Hidden Valley particles, the carriers of new forces, and other possible new phenomena as well as measure the detailed properties of the top and bottom quarks and the W and Z bosons in an attempt to understand what is beyond the Standard Model. Important discoveries are likely, but determining what the new phenomena are will not be easy. Large numbers of signal events are needed for such measurements, with as little background as possible. Tracking is essential for selecting events containing heavy fermions. At such luminosity, where large occupancy in the tracking detectors greatly increases track reconstruction time, only a small fraction of the events selected by the level-1 trigger could have track reconstruction done. The FTK, on the other hand, does global tracking three orders of magnitude more quickly than software reconstruction. As a result, it will enhance the physics reach for a broad range of ATLAS studies increasing the number of events retained for offline analysis by a factor of ten or more for broad classes of possible new phenomena. This means that if the new physics is dominated by such processes, ATLAS will be able to collect as many signal events in a year with much improved signal-to-background as it would without the FTK in a decade at the same luminosity. <br/><br/>This system is not only crucial for the ATLAS experiment, advancing the physics program of over 3000 scientists world-wide with 600 in the U.S., including over 200 graduate students from 40 institutions, but will also promote innovations in detector technology. The university groups in this proposal have a tradition for involving undergraduate and graduate students in detector development projects and this project will bring unique opportunities for training and teaching modern electronics and computing to a variety of levels of young people. It will be one of the most sophisticated systems built in high energy physics. Under the supervision of professors and engineers, graduate students and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups, will collaborate in designing, building, and testing electronic boards, writing the firmware and software, and comparing to simulation - all marketable skills. Two of the five PIs are female thereby promoting diversity. This extremely fast pattern recognition technology that would be developed for the FTK could have a profound impact on all future versions of collider and astrophysics experiments as well as applications to other field such as medical imaging. As an example, in proton computed tomography the pattern recognition technology has the potential to increase data acquisition rates and thus reduce imaging time with improved resolution.|1

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. <br/><br/>One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. <br/><br/>But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Such measurements lie at the heart of this project.<br/><br/>There is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) spurred in part by the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) project at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in general. This award supports work which refines LArTPC technology, using a test beam and at the MicroBooNE experiment at FNAL.<br/><br/>LArTPC detector technology is scalable to the very large masses (perhaps 10 kiloTons) needed by next generation neutrino experiments and is capable of recording three-dimensional digital images of particle trajectories. The MicroBooNE will have an active volume of 80 tons of liquid argon and 8256 wires spread over three instrumented wireplanes making up the Time Projection Chamber. MicroBooNE will make a variety of interesting physics measurements, as well as serving as a proving ground for new hardware techniques relevant for future experiments. Among MicroBooNE's primary physics goals is to provide a cross-check of the ""low-energy excess"" of electron neutrino events previously identified by the MiniBooNE experiment. There have been recent ""hints"" that there may be a new type of neutrino, the so-called sterile neutrino. The MicroBoone experiment, with the superior LArTPC, should clarify the situation: either rule out or confirm the sterile neutrino evidence. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this work will involve graduate students and undergraduates supported by this proposal receiving first-hand experience with High Energy Physics detector development, while also having access to MicroBooNE data that the graduate students will use for their dissertation analyses. The Syracuse group will continue with several outreach efforts as part of this proposal. The group maintains an outreach webpage that includes an ""Ask-a-A-Physicist"" questionnaire form as well as an active QuarkNet program."|1

What is the origin of electron and quark masses ? Does the Higgs boson exist ? What is the dark matter of the universe made of ? What is the origin of the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry ? In order to answer (some of) these questions from a theoretical standpoint several models have been proposed. Among these the most thoroughly analyzed are the ""standard model"" and ""supersymmetry"". A very intriguing possibility is that the symmetry between electromagnetic and weak interactions is broken dynamically by a new kind of strong force, known as ""technicolor"" (TC). Although very appealing, TC has received less attention than competing theories, because its strong nature makes it more difficult to analyze. However in the past few years a lot of progress has been made to understand strong dynamics, and we are in a position to make specific predictions about the signatures of TC at colliders. Based on the recent findings, we aim to analyze the most relevant aspects of TC phenomenology at the LHC, and propose new mechanisms for fermion mass generation in the context of TC theories."|1

LHC will collide protons at a centre of mass energy of 14 TeV with hig h luminosity, while CMS is a collaboration of more than 160 universities and research centres of 36 countries. CMS will start its operations in June 2007 when LHC will provide data; until then, the main task will be to have the detector and the Tracker in p articular, ready for the first collisions. After that, the commissioning of the detector will begin followed by the data taking (2008). The intention of the project here presented is to participate in all these steps in order to be ready to do physics analysis with data at CMS, once the performance of the Tracker subdetector is understood. The Tracker subdetector constitutes the main tool to tag b quarks (b-tagging), the principal decay product of high mass particles in LHC. Its construction, readout and calibration will be a total challenge for the CMS collaboration and at the same time, the main device to perform the foreseen physics program. This project intends to participate in the qualification and calibration of the Tracker.The study of the top quark p roperties represents a basic reference to understand the performance of CMS and LHC, given the high cross-section of the top-antitop pair production foreseen. The objective is to begin with the study of the dileptonic channel in all its aspects, and to ext end it afterwards to the semileptonic one. The search for Higgs bosons is the last piece of the SM puzzle and its natural extension, the MSSM. The process bbH/A -> bbbb, is the most likely to happen for neutral Higgs bosons in the MSSM inside the LHC framework.

This program capitalizes on their established expertise in tau lepton reconstruction and identification and their growing expertise in top quark physics. They exploit this focused toolset to perform searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), targeting interesting new physics such as the so far elusive Higgs boson, new high mass resonances, Supersymmetry, grand unification of the fundamental forces, and dark matter.

Understanding EWSB is both the last major aspect of the highly successful Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM) which needs to be resolved, and also the doorway into physics beyond the SM. The Higgs mechanism is the basic spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism of the standard model, but it suffers from problems due to the potentially large radiative corrections to its key parameters, the Higgs boson mass and scale of EWSB, which conflict with the experimental bounds on them. The problem then is to find new physics which will stabilize these parameters and which will do so without fine tuning the parameters of the new physics. <br/><br/>The PI proposes to investigate two different approaches to the problem: one makes use of supersymmetry at the weak scale, and the other does not use supersymmetry, but treats the Higgs boson as a pseudo-Goldstone Boson. It turns out that these approaches will have distinctive features which have implications for experiments at the Tevatron and LHC and so so are highly relevant to the field. there are also important implications for Cosmology, including the issues of dark matter, dark energy, nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background. The PI plans thoroughly to explore all of these aspects of EWSB. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposal are mainly concerned with the training of graduate students and postdocs at the university and at summer schools, but also contain a worthwhile outreach program to high schools and the general public.|1

Indeed, numerous studies have demonstrated that a Higgs boson with couplings given by the Standard Model is observable in several channels over the full range of allowed masses. Furthermore, if super symmetry has any relevance to the electro weak interaction, it will be discovered and the properties of many of the new particles predicted will be measured accurately. Other new physics, such as the existence of extra dimensions can also be probed, increasing the sensitivity of current experiments by more than an order of magnitude. The challenge presented to the LHC experiments is the identification of these new physics processes amidst the much more copious occurrence of well-understood and studied processes. The research subject of this network is the study, design and implementation of the event selection for an LHC experiment. The network aims at bringing together experimental physicists who are currently working on the reconstruction of different physics objects (electrons, muons, jets and missing transverse energy and b/tau jets). The network will thus provide a forum where people will study ways of maximizing the effectiveness of their corresponding algorithms. It will also add a new dimension to their current work namely the combination of these single physics objects into full physics signatures. Finally, the network will provide an excellent training ground for young postdoctoral associates who will be expected to grow into leaders of much of the physics analysis during the LHC era.|1

It has been tested by a large number of experiments at CERN LEP, SLAC SLC and the Fermilab Tevatron colliders at the level of a few tenths of percent. The long awaited discovery of the top quark at the Tevatron in 1995 gave another strong confirmation of the SM. However, the mechanism of the Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB) which generates masses for the W and Z bosons as well as the fermions, and leaves the electromagnetic gauge symmetry intact is via the Higgs boson which has not yet been found. In addition, the SM cannot explain the hierarchical pattern of fermion masses. It is therefore widely believed that at high energies, or in very high precision measurements, deviation from the SM will appear in experimental data to signal the presence of new physics.

The grant period coincides with the first experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, which will probe QCD processes to unprecedented precision and discriminate among proposed models of electroweak symmetry breaking. One strand of the PIs' research in theoretical particle physics addresses the origins of mass. They study the causes of electroweak symmetry breaking (responsible for the masses of the W and Z particles that transmit the weak nuclear force) and the mechanisms responsible for the diverse masses of the quarks and leptons, the elementary constituents of matter. While the Standard Model of particle physics can accommodate massive particles, it does so by invoking a particle (the Higgs particle) that has not yet been observed and it does not explain the dynamics through which mass arises. Hence, the PIs seek to advance the understanding of the origins of mass by using field theory, model building, and computer simulation to explore physics that lies outside the Standard Model. Of particular interest are ""Higgs-less"" models whose only new particles are massive vector bosons, heavier analogs of the W and Z . They plan to construct new models of this kind that can provide insight into the masses of the quarks and leptons, analyze the experimental consequences of such models, and propose incisive new tests based on LHC data. <br/>Another strand of the PIs' research stresses topics, such as QCD and the properties of the Higgs boson, that are both intrinsically interesting within the Standard Model and also necessary precursors for many studies of physics beyond the Standard Model.

Its intent is to study CP violation and the rare decays of long-lived K-mesons. CP violation is thought to be the origin of the a symmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe. KTEV is an experiment of fundamental importance to our understanding of the origins and evolution of the universe. At the `Collider Detector at Fermilab` (CDF) experiment, the focus is to study high momentum transfer events in proton-antiproton collisions at 1.8 TeV (the highest energy available in the world today). The Chicago group has the responsibility of constructing the electronic systems for the first level calorimeter trigger and the silicon tracker processor. The CDF experiment is being upgraded so that it can exploit the higher luminosity to be provided by the new main injector ring now under construction. The CDF experiment was one of the co- discoverers of the top quark. The `Omni-Purpose-Apparatus-at-LEP` (OPAL) collaboration at the Large Electron-Positron collider (LEP) at CERN has completed a program that uses Z boson decays to conduct several important tests of the `Standard Model` of particle physics: a measurement of the Weinberg angle, a study of various B-meson decays, and a search for exotic particles that would indicate physics beyond the `Standard Model`. The collaboration is now taking data at `LEP200`, where with double its present energy, the accelerator can make W meson pairs and hence obtain direct measurements of the W mass. Searches for new particles are also being conducted at these higher energies. ATLAS (A Toroidal Large Angle Spectrometer) will be a general-purpose detector designed to exploit the potential of the future LHC proton-proton collider. LHC will provide 10 times higher center-of-mass energy and 100 times higher proton-proton collision rates than previous colliders, thus opening up a new frontier of physics. Discovery of the mass- generating mechanism or spontaneous symmetry breaking, which predicts the existence of a scalar particle, the Higgs boson is a primary objective of ATLAS.

On the more theoretical side, building on previous studies (of this author and collaborators), continued work on the effects of a finite-temperature heat bath on the stability of spacetime is planned. Finally, two projects involving properties of theories with unbroken supersymmetry are also proposed. One is the investigation of sum rules in supersymmetric quantum mechanics and their relation to special function theory in mathematics. The other will involve one-loop calculations of various cross-sections to test for the existence of amplitude zeros beyond tree level in supersymmetric theories. This work, by a very highly-regarded young theoretical physicist, will add to our understanding of the physics of certain elementary particles that, while so-far undiscovered, are widely believed to exist, and are central to our picture of the basic forces of nature.|1

The AMY detector is located at an intersection region of TRISTAN where micro-beta magnets will be used to increase the data collection rate by a factor of three to four above that possible with the other TRISTAN detectors. The field of research is that of experimental elementary particle physics. This research studies the basic building blocks of matter (e.g., electrons, positrons, quarks, and Higgs bosons) at very high energies. The experiments use accelerators (colliders) which provide the highest energy particles made in the laboratory. The data is collected and analyzed using highly complex and sophisticated apparatus and techniques.|1

In addition to searching for the Higgs, the LHC has an ambitious program of research aimed at searching for ""new physics"" --- that is, physics beyond the Standard Model. The next few years could witness exciting discoveries as LHC experimentalists map out physics at the TeV energy scale. Professor Kiers will undertake a theoretical investigation focused on constructing observables that can be used to search for new physics and to distinguish among different types of new physics, should physics beyond the Standard Model be discovered. The research will be broken down into several projects. One of the main projects involves using the production and decay of the top quark to search for new physics. A second major project, which will be undertaken as part of a joint theoretical-experimental collaboration, focuses on supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model. Finally, complementary projects are envisioned that could provide analytical tools to help search for or analyze new physics effects in other systems. New experimental results, as they become available, will also provide significant direction regarding which observables or models of new physics will be considered.<br/><br/>The work undertaken by Professor Kiers will also have a significant impact in a broader sense at Taylor University.

The Atlas (Air Torpid Loc Apparatus System) experiment is a major detector devoted to the search of the Higgs boson and to the exploration of new physics, beyond the current Standard Model of the electro weak and strong interactions. The Higgs boson is a new particle, yet not found, which could explain the origin of the mass of the elementary particles. The direct observation of new particles will be done through their decay products (electrons, photons...) and energy balance. The object-oriented software for the reconstruction of particles within the sub-detectors of Atlas requires the development of tools capable of analysis on massive events, on large amount of data, using elaborate algorithms for the identification of physics channels. In the following years, the highest attention will be given to the reconstruction and identification of photons and electrons as well as the validation of this software with realistic test beam data. In particular, the laboratory intends to develop tools to help to calibrate the electromagnetic calorimeter, which is a fundamental sub-detector of Atlas. This requires the identification of low-momentum electrons, by combining information from two distinct detectors: the inner detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter.The laboratory is also strongly involved in the test beam performed on full-scale series modules of the future detector. The applicant researcher is expected to take responsibilities in these activities. Such activities require the best knowledge of the detectors and physics simulations. They therefore represent the possibility for young researchers to train and gain in expertise in instrumental and software techniques at the leading edge of the technical knowledge.|1

However, it does not naturally explain the particle mass spectrum, the breaking of electroweak gauge symmetry, or the different strengths of the QCD and GWS couplings: these deficiencies strongly indicate the existence of a Higgs particle and possible new interactions at energies which will become available in the near future. Perturbation theory, a power series expansion, may be used to study QCD at high energies. However, the expansion parameter is not small and higher-order corrections are substantial. These corrections will be computed for various lepton and hadron reactions to obtain reliable predictions of cross section normalizations, and transverse momentum and other distributions. These predictions will allow for more precise tests of QCD; they will aid in studying non-perturbative effects due to strong quark-gluon forces in initial-state hadrons and in hadron jets; and they will facilitate unambiguous identification of signals of the electroweak and possible new interactions. Production of GWS gauge bosons and of the Higgs boson will be studied: signals will be compared with QCD backgrounds, and unusual signals which exhibit properties, such as parity-violation, that are not shared by the background will be identified. These results, to be obtained by a very highly-regarded and capable elementary particle theorist, will enable precision tests of the Standard Model to be made at accelerators presently in operation or under construction, and will aid in the design and execution of experiments searching for new particles and interactions at future super colliders.|1

They report on all aspects of distributed computing technology, such as grids and clouds. They also regularly feature articles on distributed computing-enabled research in a large variety of disciplines, including physics, biology, sociology, earth sciences, archaeology, medicine, disaster management, crime, and art. (Note that they do not cover stories that are purely about commercial technology) In its current incarnation, iSGTW is also an online destination where you can host a profile and blog, and find and disseminate announcements and information about events, deadlines, and jobs. What many people outside of particle physics may not know is that distributed computing played a crucial role in the race towards the discovery of the Higgs Boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. <br/><br/>At present, each issue of iSGTW includes three feature articles, a visual, and a spotlight. Visuals present opportunities to showcase something graphic in nature, such as scientific visualizations, while spotlights feature a variety of links, news articles, papers, and so forth. Both items are typically written in a more casual style, with only a small amount of text. iSGTW feature articles are typically 500 - 1,500 words, but sometimes run longer. iSGTW coverage attempts to be rigorously neutral, never favoring projects affiliated with its funding source or Advisory Board, and maintaining balance across world regions. <br/><br/>The iSGTW website, re-launched in January 2011, also has a number of new and exciting community service features. Readers can post announcements, advertise jobs, and add events to the calendar and everything appears on the front page. News feeds on related topics also appeal to readers looking for more background. Similarly, the website has basic social networking functionality: visitors can leave comments, share content, create profiles, and blog.<br/><br/>A large proportion of the news stories covering cyberinfrastructure-enabled research do not mention the computational side of the story. By publishing well-written science stories that explain the computational aspects of the research, iSGTW ensures that taxpayers, policy makers, and other interested readers understand the role of cyberinfrastructure in scientific endeavors.<br/><br/>As a long-established publication, iSGTW has earned the trust of a range of audiences. Furthermore, as an international collaboration with the explicit support of diverse cyberinfrastructures (such as the Open Science Grid and XSEDE), iSGTW is better able to maintain impartiality and credibility, as compared to publications from individual institutions. The general public and members of the press are more likely to give weight to the stories iSGTW runs, and news outlets are more likely to pick them up.<br/><br/>This theory is supported by the growing number of journalists subscribing to iSGTW. In the July 2009 reader survey, only 3% of iSGTW readers identified as journalists. In the most recent survey, that rose to 7%. The subscription list currently includes approximately 130 journalists, not counting those affiliated with foreign-language media. Publications represented include The New York Times, NPR, Science/AAAS, and the Washington Post. iSGTW's email subscriber list has grown to approximately 8,180 today. Web readership is split evenly between the US and the EU, with approximately 40% of viewers hailing from each continent. Viewers from the Asia Pacific region constitute another 13%. Four percent are from the Central and South American sub-continents. The remainder are from Western Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.|1

The existence of these partners is a prediction of many approaches to solving the hierarchy problem: that is, the question of why the mass of the Higgs boson is small compared to fundamental scales in physics. In essence, the role of these new partners is to cancel quantum corrections to the Higgs mass which arise from standard model particles. The top quark is responsible for the largest correction to the Higgs mass in the standard model, and therefore the mass of its partner is expected to be well within the experimental reach of the LHC.Theorists have proposed a variety of models which solve the hierarchy problem. Some of these models have been studied in detail but others have not. This proposal will fill the holes in our knowledge of what physics at the LHC will look like if there is a solution to the hierarchy problem in nature. The approach will be very general, focusing on effective field theories which incorporate approximate cancellations of the corrections to the Higgs mass. We will identify and describe experimental signatures of the models and validate these signatures by numerical simulations. We will also investigate the question of whether new developments in the understanding of scattering amplitudes open new methods for discovering the new symmetries which are usually required to cancel the quantum corrections.In addition to the value of this research, the proposal will contribute to the competitiveness of European science by transferring knowledge of particle physics from the US to Europe. This knowledge transfer will occur through mentoring students; teaching courses and public outreach activities. The researcher will move from the US to begin a long-term career in physics research in Europe.|1

Additionally the group is working with matrix element techniques that can be applied to the search for a non-Standard Model W boson which might decay into a single top quark plus a bottom quark.

The aim is to calculate cross-sections and differential distributions that are needed for the study of the top quark, and searches for the Higgs boson and supesymmetric particles.

Deviations from these predictions can then be viewed with confidence as evidence for new physics. This type of phenomenology is an essential ingredient in the effort to maximise the physics return on the large investment by the U.S. in the LHC and its associated detectors. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this proposal involve the close interaction between theorists and experimentalists in the preparation of experiments and the analysis of the data obtained.

One of the primary goals of the LHC is to study the phenomena which lead to the breaking of the electroweak symmetry, and therefore to search for the Higgs boson. In order to extract the most information from the data that the LHC will be providing, it is important to be able to obtain theoretical predictions which are at least as accurate as the expected experimental measurements. The main objective of Professor Ferroglia's research is to contribute to the calculation of the top-quark pair production beyond next-to-leading order (NLO). In particular, Professor Ferroglia plans to calculate two-loop matrix elements for the gluon-fusion and quark-annihilation channels, and study the resummation of large logarithmic corrections at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy by applying a recently developed resummation procedure based on soft-collinear effective theory. These results will enable scientists to obtain precise theoretical predictions for some important top-quark observables that will be measured at the LHC.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. The proposed research plan will be carried out at New York City College of Technology (CUNY).

The LHC will generate proton collisions with unprecedented energies of 14 TeV. One of the main goals of the ATLAS program is to discover the Higgs partic le which is directly related to the fundamental nature of matter and the basic forces shaping our universe. Efficient identification of all lepton species is crucial at the LHC. The tau-leptons are the most difficult to identify but they can provide unique and important information. Within the frame of the Standard Model (SM) and the Minimal Super-symmetric Standard Model (MSSM) Higgs boson(s) can decay to tau's with significant branching ratios. Hadronically decaying tau's are also very important discovery signature for the Super-symmetry. In the first year of data taking, the physics program of ATLAS foresees studies of the SM background channels: Z->tau tau and W->tau neutrinos a crucial step towards monitoring and calibrating performance of the detector. Within this project the applicant will develop an algorithm for identification of the hadronically decaying tau's. Their reconstruction is one of the most challenging as it combines information from two distinct sub-detectors, the Inner Detector (ID) a nd the calorimeter, and thus requires the best knowledge of the detector and physics simulations. The host organisation, Institute of Nuclear Physics, is committed in the preparation of the ATLAS ID. The skills acquired by the applicant during EIF with the ATLAS software and gained knowledge of the electromagnetic calorimeter will be extremely valuable for the proposed studies. Merging experience of both groups, of the host institute and of the fellowship institute, represents the possibility for the applicant to train and gain in expertise, become a valuable member of the research group and prepare for a successful participation in the analysis of the early LHC data in spring 2008.|1

The Level 1 trigger needs to operate in real time and sample interactions at a 40 MHz rate making a determination if the interaction that took place is of physics interest and should be kept for further investigation. The proposal includes the R&D needed for such addition, as well as the physical implementation and testing of the hardware. The CMS upgrade is planned to be executed in two phases. The first phase should be completed in four to five years and this proposal covers all stages from the design and system definitions up to and including the start of construction. The second phase will take an additional four to five years and this proposal covers the period up to the completion of the conceptual design and studies needed to define the project in detail.

Considering the success over the last decade of new colliders at Fermilab, SLAC, CERN, DESY, and that others are due to begin operation this year, collider physics will continue to grow as an important branch of High Energy Physics. The Standard Model of particle physics is generally believed to be incomplete. The investigators will explore phenomenological implications of Physics Beyond the Standard Model for current and future experiments at high energy colliders. Examples include the search for supersymmetry, for Higgs bosons the only Standard Model particle yet to be discovered, as well as the physics of neutrinos whose masses could provide clues to physics at high energy.

All coinvestigators have been actively engaged in phenomenological research for the last several years. This collaboration will allow Godbole to interact with the large experimental group at the University of Hawaii that is involved with experiments at Fermilab in the US, in China and in Japan. Scope: High energy physics is an area of research that has been identified as a thrust area by the Indian Government and is one of tremendous activity and strength among Indian physicists.

The system, to be known as the Sun Constellation Cluster, will be deployed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, located at the University of Texas at Austin. The project represents a collaboration between the University of Texas at Austin, Sun Microsystems, Advanced Micro Devices, the Cornell Theory Center at Cornell University, and the Fulton High Performance Computing Institute at Arizona State University. <br/><br/>The Sun Constellation Cluster will greatly increase the combined capacity of the computational resources of the current NSF-funded, shared-use, high-performance computing facilities and provide a capability that is an order of magnitude larger than the largest supercomputer that NSF currently supports. Because of this, it will advance research and education across a broad range of topical areas in science and engineering that use high-performance computing to advance understanding. With this new resource, researchers will study the properties of minerals at the extreme temperatures and pressures that occur deep within the Earth. They will use it to simulate the development of structure in the early Universe. They will probe the structure of novel phases of matter such as the quark-gluon plasma. Such computing capabilities enable the modeling of life cycles that capture interdependencies across diverse disciplines and multiple scales to create globally competitive manufacturing enterprise systems. The system will permit researchers to examine the way proteins fold and vibrate after they are synthesized inside an organism. Sophisticated numerical simulations will permit scientists and engineers to perform a wide range of in silico experiments that would otherwise be too difficult, too expensive or impossible to perform in the laboratory. <br/><br/>High-performance computing of the sort that will be possible with the new system is also essential to the success of research and education conducted with sophisticated experimental tools. For example, without the waveforms produced by numerical simulations of black hole collisions and other astrophysical events, gravitational wave signals cannot be extracted from the data produced by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory; high-resolution seismic inversions from the higher density of broadband seismic observations furnished by the EarthScope project are necessary to determine shallow and deep Earth structure; simultaneous integrated computational and experimental testing is conducted on the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation to improve seismic design of buildings and bridges; and advanced computing capabilities will be essential to extracting the signature of the Higgs boson and supersymmetric particles, two of the scientific drivers of the Large Hadron Collider, from the petabytes of data produced in the trillions of particle collisions. <br/><br/>This project presents an exciting opportunity to advance the type of research described above by: (i) greatly extending the capacity of high-performance computational resources available to the science and engineering communities, (ii) extending the range of advanced computations that can be handled by providing a system with a very large amount of memory, and a very large amount of processing capability. This system will use an architecture that is similar to that present in many academic institutions and to which many science and engineering applications have been ported. In addition, the system represents an important stepping-stone towards the goal of the use of petascale computing in science and engineering research and education at the end of the decade. It will provide a platform that will allow researchers to experiment with techniques for overcoming one of the hurdles in the path to petascale computing, scaling to very large numbers of processors. This computing system will also provide opportunities to many graduate students and post-docs to gain experience in using high-performance computing systems<br/><br/>The Texas Advanced Computing Center and its partners will broaden the impact of the computing resource by: teaching in situ and online classes for undergraduate and graduate students in high-performance computing, visualization, data analysis, and grid computing for computational research in science and engineering; partnering with faculty and students at a number of Minority Serving Institutions to provide training in the use of high-performance computing resources; and collaborating with the Girlstart program, a program that supports and enhances the interest of girls in math, science, and technology.|1

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. <br/><br/>One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. <br/><br/>But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>The achievements of particle physics during the last few decades have been enabled by the progress that has been made in the development and utilization of extremely sophisticated elementary particle detector technology, some of which has resulted in applications that have over time enjoyed spin offs into other areas of science. The primary goal of most of this technology is to reduce the level of noise in the detector to enable increasingly weaker signals to be observed. <br/><br/>There is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in liquid argon Time Projection Chambers (TPC) spurred in part by the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) project at Fermi National Acclerator Laboratory (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in general. This award supports the group of C. Bromberg at Michigan State University to work on the construction of a low noise readout system for the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) to be used in the LArIAT (Liquid Argon In A Test-beam) experiment at FNAL. The unique aspect of these electronics is that it uses cold preamplifiers, cooled by submerging them in Liquid Argon (87 degrees above absolute zero), that reduces electronic noise by 50% compared to room temperature electronics. FNAL is providing the test neutrino beam and associated detectors. This project will focus solely on the fabrication of the cold readout system.<br/><br/>LArTPC detector technology is scalable to the very large masses (perhaps 100kiloTons) needed by next generation neutrino experiments and is capable of recording three-dimensional digital images of particle trajectories. For these experiments systematic errors in the energy measurements are not well known. This project will help understand these errors and a crucial component will be the low-noise electronics.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this work involves training of an engineer in Liquid Argon technology. The PI also contributes to the US Particle Accelerator School using LAr TPCs as teaching tools.|2

Although it is a relatively straightforward generalization of quantum electrodynamics, the underlying theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), is difficult to solve, especially in the context of structure. Although lattice QCD has made important progress, observations are clearly still important to make the theory's phenomena come to life. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne program focuses on the spin and flavor structure of the nucleon in a variety of experiments at high energies where key elements of the microscopic role of quarks, anti-quarks and gluons are poorly understood. The PHENIX polarized pp program, while continuing to measure the contribution of gluons to the nucleon spin, will enter a new phase of measuring the contributions of antiquarks, taking advantage of an Illinois-led muon trigger upgrade. The SEAQUEST experiment at Fermilab will follow on the very successful E866 measurement of the intriguing asymmetry of up and down anti-quarks in the nucleon with more precise data over a broader kinematic range. The Illinois group has recently joined the fixed target COMPASS experiment at CERN, where they will make a major contribution to an apparatus upgrade that will take the next step in characterizing the transverse spin structure of the nucleon. Together, these efforts - with substantial Illinois contributions - promise significant advances in the understanding of QCD. Beyond the current standard model of particle physics must lie new phenomena, only the shadows of which are currently visible. The Illinois group contributes to these investigations through low-energy experiments designed to follow the leads provided by certain non-standard-model phenomena. In the neutrino sector, where even the existence of non-zero masses was a surprise not contemplated in the standard model, the Illinois group is working on the Daya Bay experiment. Currently taking its first data, Daya Bay will make the world's most sensitive determination of the mixing of the first and third neutrino generations, theta_(13). In the standard model, the violation of the combined charge-conjugation and parity (CP) symmetry is added 'by hand' and is not well-understood. A new measurement of the neutron's electric dipole moment (EDM), which violates CP, aims at a 100-fold improvement compared with the present limit. These measurements are important on their own merits, but may also shed light on the observed asymmetry of matter and anti-matter in the universe. The existence of this asymmetry is thought to require more CP violation than is currently known, and may arise from interactions that would generate an EDM in the neutron, and or in the neutrino sector where it would manifest in CP-violating mixing between the first and third generations. <br/><br/><br/>The Illinois group has reached beyond its laboratories to make significant contributions to education and outreach and will continue to do so. Research projects contribute substantially to the education of a large number of postdoctoral research associates, graduate, and undergraduate students. The faculty are also involved in innovative curricular and outreach efforts. Examples include introduction of research equipment and measurement protocols into advanced modern physics laboratories, establishment of a graduate option in energy and sustainability engineering, inventing new inter-disciplinary math/engineering teaching protocols targeted directly at retention, continued support of a Saturday lecture program aimed primarily at high school students, and a major contribution to the Physics of Baseball, a topic having wide public interest. Our group and Department expect to continue to support strongly the participation of underrepresented groups, for example, acting as host for the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics in 2008.|2

This decay rate is central to understanding the reactions thought to power the sun. The detector is based on the use of approximately 100 tons of liquid scintillator to detect recoil electrons following neutrino-electron interaction in the detector volume. A large array of photomultiplier tubes will sense the light produced in the liquid scintillator by the recoil electron. Because of the very low rate of events, great attention will be paid to reducing backgrounds from cosmic rays and naturally occurring radioisotopes in the detector proper and the surrounding material. In order to reduce cosmic ray backgrounds, the detector will be located underground. The site chosen is the Gran Sasso underground tunnel in Italy. Construction of this detector, known as Borexino, is an international project involving Italy, Germany, and the US. Results from this experiment will test the standard solar model and help place constraints on the mass of the neutrino. These topics are of great current scientific interest because of earlier results which hint at a substantial reduction in the solar neutrino flux due to neutrino mass and oscillations which are thought to take place in the sun whereby neutrinos change from one so-called flavor into another, i.e. from an electron neutrino into a muon or tau neutrino. The joint NSF/DOE Nuclear Science Advisory Committee highlighted this science in its 1996 Long Range Plan. Education of students and postdocs is a strong component of this experimental program.<br/><br/>This project is jointly supported by the Division of Physics, Division of Astronomy and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.<br/>***|2

Traditionally, support for the group's research has been obtained from the US Department of Energy - Nuclear Sciences. However, it appears unlikely that infrastructure funds to support personnel working on MECO will continue from this source. NSF is currently providing support for materials and equipment. <br/><br/>The MECO experiment is one of two experiments which constitute the Rare Symmetry Violating Processes (RSVP) physics program currently under development by the NSF. RSVP is a Major Research Equipment (MRE) program, approved by the National Science Board in February 2001, and currently scheduled to begin construction in FY 2006. The program is at present in an R&D phase, supported by R&RA funds from the Division of Physics.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/><br/>One of the principal intellectual endeavors in current physics exploration is the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model, and there are good reasons to believe that the Standard Model is at best incomplete. For example, the hierarchy of elementary particle masses has no explanation. Further, the recent observation of neutrino mixing requires at least a revision of the Standard Model to allow mass mixing in the lepton as well as the quark sector. The MECO experiment is a search for violation of Lepton Flavor in the charged lepton sector via the direct conversion of a muon to an electron within the field of an atomic nucleus. The proposed sensitivity of this experiment is three-to-four orders of magnitude below current limits; well below the levels predicted by several extensions to the Standard Model, including Supersymmetry.<br/><br/>The University of Houston is the sub-system manager for the MECO tracking detector. This tracker measures the energy of the ejected conversion electrons and is crucial to background rejection and the ultimate sensitivity of the experiment. It is composed of a cylindrical, thin-walled, straw-tube composite, ~290 cm long and ~88 cm in diameter. The proposed project will fund infrastructure so that work can proceed along three parallel paths: (1) development of computer models, calibrated to small prototype detectors, to simulate the electronic response of the detector, (2) study of the mechanical design and construction techniques required to produce a full-scale detector, and (3) development of readout electronics capable of data acquisition at the expected singles rates, digitization, and presentation for event storage in a computer buffer. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>This proposal will provide support for the education of students in both physics and modern distributed signal processing. The MECO international collaboration consists of eleven institutions, and the Houston group is presently discussing cooperative participation in the integrated circuit development with Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the Engineering Physics Department at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. It also appears that the development of the proposed rescaled digitizing integrated circuit (IC) can find application in many high-rate, multi-channel data acquisition applications from non-destructive testing to medicine.|2

However, most importantly for the next three years, the Oregon group will apply to Advanced LIGO the deep expertise gained from the initial LIGO experience in detector characterization. In particular, our leadership in finding, describing, and mitigating noise sources which are not intrinsic to the LIGO interferometers will be crucial to the success of Advanced LIGO. And it is during this period of transition, as the new systems are being installed and commissioned, that these investigations will be most valuable. This will be carried out via two main avenues of inquiry: (1) detector characterization, and (2) data analysis, especially in developing strategies to search for gravitational wave transients associated with astrophysical triggers, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) or supernovae. For detector characterization, the focus will be to interrogate Advanced LIGO sub-systems as they come on line. We will identify potentially problematic couplings of the LIGO interferometers to noise from the environment (electromagnetic, seismic, acoustic, cosmic-ray, etc), determine the physical character of the coupling, and use this knowledge to reduce or mitigate it. In data analysis and gravitational wave science, the Oregon group plans to continue to play a central role in developing strategies and analyses to search for astrophysically-triggered, transient gravitational wave signals. The overriding goal is to be ready with a full arsenal of analysis tools, including infrastructure to provide timely communication with astronomical partners, when Advanced LIGO begins science running. And as LIGO makes the transition from a discovery phase to a full program of gravitational wave science, the Oregon group will be poised to exploit the rich scientific opportunities available.<br/><br/>During the next three years, the quest for the discovery of gravitational waves -- a fundamental natural phenomenon predicted by Einstein's General Relativity -- will enter a critical phase. The LIGO project is transitioning to its ""advanced"" phase. Advanced LIGO, when complete in about three years, is expected to have the exquisite sensitivity required to directly detect gravitational wave signals for the first time. This discovery, when realized, will usher in a new era of astronomy and astrophysics, as gravitational waves will provide a unique view of the cosmos, distinct from that provided by light, radio, x-rays, gamma rays, neutrinos, or other astronomical messengers."|2

The neutrinos are fundamental particles that play key roles in the early universe, in cosmology and astrophysics, and in nuclear and particle physics. Results from neutrino oscillation experiments have provided compelling evidence that neutrinos have mass and give the first indication that the Standard Model of nuclear and particle physics is incomplete. A 1-tonne detector searching for neutrino-less double beta-decay will be about 100 times more sensitive than current measurements and will confirm or exclude the inverted mass hierarchy for Majorana neutrinos. To achieve the ultimately realizing 1-tonne scale detectors using Ge detectors, the Majorana and GERDA collaborations have established a formal cooperative agreement. The collaborations have agreed to share resources and knowledge in their development of detector designs to reach for a Majorana mass sensitivity below 50 meV. This proposal requests support for the design of a 1-tonne-scale Ge experiment.

If neutrinos are Majorana particles, the mechanism that gives them mass is not part of the Standard Model of particle physics and requires new physics. The most practical way to observe that neutrinos are Majorana particles is to see the neutrino-less double beta decay, a process that explicitly violates the conservation of lepton number. The work supported by this award will develop new techniques for increasing the concentration of metals that can be loaded into liquid scintillator detectors. The near-term physics goal is to improve the sensitivity of neutrino-less double beta decay searches with large underground liquid scintillator experiments, such as the SNO+ experiment. The sensitivity of SNO+ is a function of both the quantity of double beta decay Neodymium isotope that can be dissolved in the scintillator, and the detector's overall energy resolution: more isotope increases the signal, while improved resolutions allow better separation of signal from background. The limit to the total mass of isotope that can be dissolved comes from the competition between the additional statistics and the loss of light due to absorption by Neodymium. This work will carry out a dedicated investigation into the loading of Neodymium nanoparticles, rather than dissolving Neodymium directly, as a way to add more isotope while limiting the level of light lost, thus significantly improving sensitivity to a neutrino-less double beta decay signal. The plan of work includes development of loading techniques to ensure homogeneity and stability within the scintillator, measurements of optical transmission and scattering of the suspensions, measurements of light yield and scintillation timing profiles, and simulation and analysis to determine the impact of nanoparticle solutions on SNO+'s sensitivity to neutrino-less double beta decay. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/>The question of whether the neutrino is its own antiparticle is not only the most pressing question in neutrino physics, it also has implications for the origin of the current preponderance of matter over antimatter in our Universe. The techniques that will be investigated here can also be applied equally well to other liquid-scintillator detectors, including planned very large-scale detectors such as LENS. They may also be useful for the loading of any non-double beta decay isotope, for purposes that could go well beyond neutrino physics. The work described here will also play an important role in the training and education of young researchers. It is very well-suited to the involvement of undergraduates, both in hands-on activities as well as simple data analysis and simulation.|2

The high-energy particles, called cosmic-rays, are accelerated by shock waves and other turbulent processes associated with the release of massive amounts of gravitational energy, which also lead to spectacular displays in visible light, X-rays, and other wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The focus of this research is on analysis of data that will lead to a better understanding of the specific types of sources and mechanisms that are responsible for the highest energy cosmic particles.<br/>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, now under construction at the National Science Foundation's Amundsen-Scott South-Pole Station, will use the clear, deep ice of the Antarctic glacier as a large target for detecting weakly interacting neutrinos, which are also expected from certain cosmic-ray sources, but which have so far not been found. The neutrino observatory, when complete, will consist of 4800 optical modules monitoring more than a cubic kilometer of ice for flashes of light characteristic of neutrino interactions. The primary signature for a neutrino in IceCube will be an upward-moving event from a neutrino that has penetrated the Earth. IceCube includes an array of detectors on the surface that serve as a partial veto for the down-going background of penetrating muons created by cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere above IceCube. <br/>The surface array, called IceTop, will consist of 160 tanks of ice, each instrumented with two standard IceCube optical modules, to detect showers of secondary particles generated by interactions of high-energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere. The analysis supported by this grant will focus on cosmic-ray events detected in coincidence by both the surface array and the deep detectors. The ratio of deep signal to surface signal can be used to measure the relative fraction of heavy cosmic rays (e.g. nuclei of iron) to light cosmic rays (e.g. protons) in an energy region not accessible to direct observation with detectors carried above the atmosphere on balloons or spacecraft. In particular we will look for a characteristic signature of a transition from sources inside our Milky Way Galaxy to extra-Galactic sources at higher energy. We will also analyze data taken simultaneously by the Radio Ice Cherenkov Experiment, looking for coincidences with IceTop as a way of extending our research to still higher energy. As of 2006, IceCube has 9 strings of 60 detectors each in the ice, and there are 32 IceTop tanks in operation. It is already the largest detector of its kind, and analysis will start as construction proceeds.<br/>During the course of this grant we will consolidate and improve our outreach efforts into a coherent program We will start by creating a web page about the science and techniques, with connections to the IceCube photo and video collection. Then we will formalize and extend our current program of occasional lectures for K-12 students and the public.|2

The scientific analyses in AMANDA can be classified as follows: (a) Atmospheric muon flux: the cosmic ray muon flux has been used to do a precision calibration of the detector with high statistics; (b) Atmospheric neutrinos: AMANDA's performance has been calibrated by reconstructing upward-going muons produced by atmospheric muon neutrinos. The detector, in steady operation, collects roughly four neutrinos per day using fast on-line analysis software. The atmospheric neutrino spectrum is now measured up to 100 TeV; (c) Cascades produced by the secondary electromagnetic and hadronic showers initiated by electron and tau neutrinos. The flux level is approaching where the much lower atmospheric neutrino fluxes should be observed, as well as the prompt flux from the decay of heavy quarks can be measured; (d) Search for point sources of cosmic neutrinos such as supernova remnants, mini-quasars, active galaxies; (e) Search for a diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos; (f) Search for gamma ray bursts; and (g) Extremely high energy events from cosmological remnants or mini-black holes, magnetic monopoles, cold dark matter particles. The UW plays a major role in all analyses except for the last one. With the University of Delaware, the UW group determined that the fraction of heavy elements in the cosmic ray flux increases with energy in the region of the knee, by studying the muon response of AMANDA to air showers detected by the SPASE array deployed at the surface. The UW AMANDA group has pioneered many of the programs that are now part of the extensive IceCube education and outreach program including the Science in the Ice course that involves high school teachers and their students, as well as participants in the TEA (Teacher Experience in Antarctica) program.|2

The goal is to establish the identity of as yet unknown sources and explicate still unknown acceleration mechanism(s). Those are subjects of intense current interest and activity. One major thrust is the development of MILAGRO, a new air-shower detector that makes use of Cerenkov radiation produced by shower parties in a large pool of water.

When high energy cosmic rays interact with matter, magnetic fields and ambient photons they generate high energy gamma rays and/or neutrinos of high energy. Some of these neutral particles travel directly to the earth and, when observed by gamma ray telescopes, can both provide essential information about not only the origin and distribution of cosmic rays and their sources, but also can serve as probes for gamma rays expected from the annihilation of dark matter. Thus they allow the study fundamental high energy astrophysics as well as particle physics. As the flux of these high energy gamma rays is small, large acceptance detectors with good pointing and adequate cosmic ray rejection capabilities are essential for this study. <br/><br/>The Milagro detector uses a new technique to detect high energy gamma rays. It allows the simultaneous and continuous viewing of the entire overhead sky in the TeV energy domain. It detects the bundles of energetic particles produced by high energy gamma ray interacting in the atmosphere, which acts like an amplifier of each high energy photon. Detection occurs by sampling light photons produced by these relativistic particles in a 6 million gallon water tank instrumented with 737 photomultiplier tubes. The pulse height and arrival times of these photons permit reconstruction of the celestial direction of the original particle, as well as rejection of most of the unwanted cosmic ray showers. Its continuous operation allows observation of both steady and transient sources of TeV gamma rays. <br/><br/>Milagro has detected and measured the energy spectrum of gamma rays from the Crab neubla; from active galactic nuclei (AGNS) blazars Mrk 501 and 421 in their active phases; from a gamma ray burster (GRB); and of diffuse TeV gamma ray emission from the inner galactic disc region from interaction of cosmic rays with matter in the galactic disc, and from TeV gamma ray sources in the Cygnus arm of the galaxy. These observations provide new and important data for the understanding of the origin, acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays. Under this NSF grant, work will continue on refining the observations of these and other possible objects, and on analyzing the data.<br/><br/>The Milagro experiment and data have provided excellent training ground for undergraduate student research experience and for graduate student training in hardware and software. UCI also has several active programs, such as COSMOS and Quarknet , for outreach to K-12 teachers and students. We have been involved in communicating to school students at K-12 levels and to seniors (Academy of Continued Life Long learning).|2

As a theory, it incorporates all known particles and forces of nature, excluding gravity. It has been extremely successful in describing known phenomena, but we are prompted to ask whether there is physics beyond the Standard Model. Are there new forces of nature, or new states of matter, which are important to the universe? In this project, the PI intends to explore new theories of physics beyond the Standard Model, focusing on interesting phenomenological signals absent in most conventional models. He will study many topics including unexpected signals of the dark sector in terrestrial and cosmological experiments, models which allow wider ranges of flavor violation, connections between neutrino masses and dark matter, and models of dark matter motivated by cosmic ray signals. By exploring what connections could exist between these apparently disparate fields --- dark matter, cosmic rays, neutrino physics, and collider physics --- the PI hopes to gain insights into the possible nature of these diverse unexplored phenomena, and find ways in which terrestrial and cosmological studies can complement one another.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have two key broader impacts. First, the PI will maintain a continued effort to participate in summer schools and will compile a regularly updated set of lecture notes on dark matter. This will provide an important resource for graduate students or interested faculty in a rapidly evolving field. Second, the PI will continue his very successful outreach effort with the Governor's School West in Salem, North Carolina. This public summer school draws students from across the state, from varied socioeconomic backgrounds, providing an opportunity to promote physics research and careers to interested and talented students, and counsel them on pursuing such a path. This program has been highly successful over the last several years, and offers year- on-year interactions with new groups of students through an established educational setup.|2

It will contain 300 tons of liquid scintillator made of materials chosen for their low content of radioactive atoms and is located in the underground Gran Sasso laboratory in Italy. Measurements to be performed will test our understanding of how the Sun produces energy and our understanding of neutrinos. <br/>The Sun is thought to derive its energy from a series of nuclear fusion reactions that convert four hydrogen nuclei into a helium nucleus, with the release of a large amount of energy (26.7 MeV). The reactions occur in the dense hot core of the sun and the energy is transferred to charged particles, gamma rays, and neutrinos. However, only the neutrinos escape into space as messengers from the hot core.<br/>The chlorine detector of Ray Davis and colleagues was the first experiment designed for solar neutrinos as a test of the solar model. Surprisingly, it recorded only about 1/3 of the neutrinos predicted. Doubts about the experiment and the solar model, on which the expected neutrino rate is based, persisted. However, after several measurements with new detectors, it became clear that both the Davis experiment and the calculated neutrino rates were correct. <br/>More recently, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Canada, using heavy water, demonstrated beyond doubt that the deficit of detected solar neutrinos was due to a fundamentally new process known as ""neutrino oscillations"". The neutrinos are produced in the sun as ""electron-neutrinos"", one of the three known neutrino states, and then oscillate to other neutrino states in their journey from the Sun to Earth. Since solar neutrino experiments detect mainly electron neutrinos, the observed rates were always smaller than expected. A process proposed by Mikheyev, Smirnov and Wolfenstein (MSF effect) would enhance oscillations by the interaction of the neutrinos with electrons in the solar core. <br/>What will Borexino contribute to the story? The first goal is to test the MSW theory. A transition in the nature of neutrino oscillations is expected to occur at a neutrino energy of approximately 2 MeV. Above the transition energy, neutrino oscillations are dominated by MSW oscillations, whereas below that energy, the matter effect is small and neutrinos should oscillate by ""vacuum oscillations"". Borexino will be the first experiment to directly detect neutrinos below the transition energy. The goal is to measure the rate of the 0.86 MeV 7Be neutrino and the 1.44 MeV pep neutrino, for which vacuum oscillations should dominate. The SNO and SuperK experiments detected high energy neutrinos, where MSW oscillations dominate. A significant change in the survival probability of the neutrinos above and below the transition energy should provide a unique test the MSW picture. <br/>A second goal of Borexino is to test whether all the energy produced by the Sun arises from the fusion reactions. This can be done by measuring the neutrino rates from all the nuclear reactions that occur in the Sun. From the observed neutrino rates, corrected for neutrino oscillations, one determines the total power produced by the Sun from nuclear reactions. This total power is then compared to the power determined from the radiant power, the photon luminosity. A difference would imply another source of energy, or possibly a non-equilibrium condition. <br/>Borexino also has applications beyond nuclear physics and astronomy. It is an ideal detector of geophysical anti-neutrinos (produced by natural radioactivity in the earth), and supernova neutrinos. Borexino will additionally provide a sensitive search for so-called sterile neutrinos and non-standard neutrino interactions. <br/>The detector was built with prior funding from the NSF and with funds from European science agencies. The goal of this proposal is to bring the detector into full operation within the next two years and to start data acquisition; significant parts of this effort will involve graduate students and postdoctoral research associates, in addition to the faculty members involved."|2

Neutrinos are unique astronomical messengers which may provide critical information in identifying sources of cosmic rays and the physics processes out of which they are born. Neutrinos retain their directional information through magnetic fields and point back to their source. They can travel long distances from their sources without significant attenuation. The observation of neutrinos from an astrophysical source would be unambiguous evidence for hadronic acceleration, since cosmic proton accelerators are expected to produce cosmic rays, gamma rays and neutrinos with similar luminosities. Recent data from HiRES and AUGER seem to support the existence of the ""GZK cutoff"", the modification of the cosmic ray spectrum due to the photoproduction effect and hence one expects a flux of ultra-high energy neutrinos from the charged pion decays.<br/><br/>Because of the low flux at extremely high energies, novel techniques must be employed to build a cost effective array large enough to gain a statistically meaningful number of events at GZK energies.

Already, experiments like Fermi GST and PAMELA are producing very exciting - though puzzling - results that may be major hints to an unexpectedly rich dark matter sector. There are many possibilities for dramatic discoveries, which will usher in a new era for dark matter and fundamental particle physics. How one combines the complementary information from these disparate measurements into a cohesive picture is not readily apparent. Initially, it is unlikely that an obvious picture will emerge that is more compelling than conventional explanations, such as poorly understood modeling or experimental systematics. Thus, one must be prepared to pose serious questions about the data, the theoretical interpretation, the experimental systematics, and additional modeling assumptions that are not limited by avoidable technical limitations. This award supports a program of physics research built around a unifying approach to large-scale scientific data analysis, initially dealing with data from LHC experiments, in a way that is scalable with respect to complexity of data, experimental apparatuses, and theoretical models. The approach could have profound impact on early standard model physics measurements and the extension to Higgs physics and beyond as well as facilitate communication and cooperation between ATLAS and CMS, between theorists and experimentalists, and among researchers from different disciplines. <br/>In terms of broader impact the key development in this award that enables the scalable approach to large-scale data analysis is applicable beyond the field of particle physics. Experiments as diverse as Fermi GST, HESS, and the IceCube neutrino telescope are already exploring the use of this technology, which is a concrete indication of the broader impacts of the proposed research. Additional impacts follow from a well-integrated educational and outreach component. A portable and professionally-designed exhibit will be constructed for use at the popular New York City World Science Festival street fair, area science fairs, career fairs, and the like. The booth will utilize existing material from the ATLAS outreach group. Additionally, the exhibit will be the basis for a project integrated into a teaching methods course in the Department of Teaching and Learning at NYU. The project will be to design activities for the exhibit itself and to develop and assess physics teaching methods. Thus, the exhibit, the activities, and the assessment of the exhibit will be the culmination of a semester-long project, and those teachers can bring the developed activities to their own schools. Finally, the PI will mentor high-school students from the Harlem Children's Society so that they can understand and operate the demonstrations, thus serving as peer-group liaisons, and role models for under-represented groups in the sciences.|2

An intelligent trigger would be used to select potential ultra-high energy cosmic ray events using a low-power air fluorescence camera and only then would power-consuming electronics be activated. Plans include tests using the HiRes 2 detector in a remote part of the Utah desert.<br/><br/>In the outreach effort of the proposal, the plan would involve high school teachers and university undergraduates building scintillation counters to detect high energy cosmic rays. These counters would then be moved to high schools in Utah and New Mexico to introduce high school students to the concepts and detector techniques of astroparticle physics. The high school program would focus on schools in Native American reservations in these states.|2

The PI also plans to also continue her work to ensure that unexpected physics --- such as that emerging from a possible low-mass hidden sector (or so-called ``Hidden Valley'') --- is not missed in analyses of data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the astrophysics and cosmology side of her work, the PI plans to focus on the indirect detection of dark matter, and on the construction and analysis of various models of neutrino physics.<br/><br/>This activity also includes a major program of education and outreach, with three specific public-outreach activities planned. The first is to develop, in collaboration with the Exhibit Museum for Natural History at the University of Michigan, a segment visualizing dark matter and its detection, on scales from the earth to clusters of galaxies. Such a segment will have a reach of 18,000 annual visitors to the museum planetarium, and many more through distribution to other planetaria nationwide. Second, the PI will present public lectures in a very popular Saturday-morning lecture series at the University of Michigan, discussing the existence of dark matter and the fundamental physics of cosmic anti-matter. Approximately 500 people attend these lectures in person, with much wider availability made through the University television station and iTunes U downloads on the web.

To address these requires a more detailed understanding, both experimentally and theoretically, of neutrino interactions in nuclear matter. With the emphasis long baseline experiments, in which matter effects are important, and on Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers as the detectors of choice for many experiments, where the relevant atomic number is A=40 for Argon, such understanding is not only necessary, but fundamental.<br/><br/>The research effort at Virginia Polytechnic and State University is aimed directly at these questions and is based on a complementary approach using experiment, theory and simulation. The objectives include: (1) to compare event generator predictions with experimental data, focusing on comparisons with measurements that the Virginia Tech group and collaborators will perform in Liquid Argon using the MicroBooNE detector; (2) to determine the impact of nuclear models, correlations and neutrino interaction uncertainties on the discovery of CP violation in the lepton sector and the experimental determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters; (3) to include state-of-the-art nuclear models in the neutrino interaction simulation and (4) to determine the level of detail needed in these models to achieve the required sensitivity to observe CP violation. The proposed research is potentially transformative, by altering and refining the scope of the GENIE neutrino event generator to predict events more precisely and interface it with the GLoBES simulator to understand the effect of neutrino interactions on the determination of neutrino oscillation parameters for past and future neutrino experiments worldwide.<br/><br/>In parallel with the research, the program includes important educational components, directed at high school and more advanced levels. The group will build upon an already active PhysTec program at Virginia Tech and will create a QuarkNet center to attract high school teachers and students, with initial emphasis on neutrino physics.

While similar to electrons, they interact very weakly with other particles. Thus, little is known about how neutrinos interact with matter. Contrary to earlier expectations, recent experiments have shown that neutrinos have a small but finite mass. The research enabled by this CAREER award will explore how the origin and consequences of neutrino mass may be probed using (1) man-made beams of neutrinos incident at a detector after passing thousands of kilometers through the earth, (2) neutrinos from galactic supernovae, and (3) collisions of high-energy protons in collider experiments. Another aspect of the research program is to study the interactions of ultra high-energy cosmic neutrinos in the hope that new phenomena at energies inaccessible at particle colliders may be discovered. The latter will utilize the extensive data expected from cosmic ray experiments and neutrino telescopes. The overall research program includes the phenomenological analyses of data, the design of future experiments and the assessment of their potential, and the formulation of theoretical neutrino mass models and their tests. <br/><br/>The impact of this work arises from the synergy between particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology related to neutrinos. The goal of the research is to improve the current understanding of the neutrino sector of the Standard Model of particle physics with a point of view that may shed light on the unification of forces, the physics applicable when the Big Bang occurred and the role of neutrinos in the evolution of the Universe. The interdisciplinary nature of the projects is bound to engender new avenues of research and will foster collaborations between researchers in diverse fields.

To seek an answer to these questions, we are about to embark in perhaps the largest enterprise that the neutrino community has known: the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE). It implies sending a powerful beam of neutrinos 800-miles through the earth from Fermilab (Illinois) to two detectors underground in the Homestake mine (South Dakota). The goal of this proposal is to replace the current standard of photodetection technology, photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), with a more modern option.

Over the next several years, our knowledge of two-flavor oscillation parameter space will be refined by several experiments, including Super-K and K2K. Assuming that a ""standard"" 3-flavor picture holds, the next steps will be to fully explore the masses and mixings in a 3-flavor context by determining the value of theta13, determining the mass hierarchy, and, ultimately, searching for CP violation in the lepton sector. Knowledge of these parameters is essential for a full understanding of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. The next promising step is to search for theta13 via an electron-neutrino appearance in a muon-neutrino beam. Because theta13, and hence the amplitude for electron-neutrino appearance, is known to be small, this is a challenging task. The J-PARCnu project, which involves a new high-intensity muon-neutrino beam originating at the J-PARC facility and sent to a refurbished Super-K far detector, will have a sensitivity to theta13 approximately 20 times better than current limits.

It is clearly extremely important to further study the oscillation and other fundamental properties of neutrinos. It is also important to improve our knowledge of neutrinos-nucleus reactions, which are crucial for understanding stellar collapse and the origin of chemical elements. These and many other interesting questions can be investigated at stopped pion neutrino facilities like the planned spallation neutron source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The SNS offers a unique opportunity to build a large neutrino detectors that are ideally suited for neutrino oscillation measurements and studying neutrino-nucleus reactions. It is clearly desirable to place this project in the broad context of the current status of neutrino physics in general and its relation to astrophysics and cosmology.

Placing the detectors deep underground greatly reduces cosmic ray backgrounds, while large active and passive shielding minimizes the background from radioactivity in the rock of the underground caverns. What remains, however, is the radioactivity inside or on the surface of the detector components. The underground physics community strives to identify and develop materials with radioactive contamination at permissible levels, and to remove radioactive contaminants from materials, but each such material represents a separate dedicated research and development effort. A direct method to establish the radioactive contamination in materials is to measure the emitted gamma radiation directly through gamma ray spectroscopy. <br/><br/>This team has access to two high purity germanium detectors in the Kimballton Underground Facility and access to the lowest background germanium detector in the world, NRL-1 at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. Part of this proposal is to use these three detectors to perform material assay on items needed for experiments. Several techniques have been developed to directly measure isotopic abundances and infer the activity. One of these methods is Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), which can measure isotopic concentrations at the part per trillion level. It is planned to make a comparison of ICP-MS and direct gamma-ray spectroscopy at levels near those required for planned experiments. <br/><br/>Radioactive radon in the air can create radioactive surface contamination on detector components. Although it is possible to create gases with a very low radon concentration, human contact with a detector during construction, assembly, and operation requires an air atmosphere.

It pertains to fundamental unanswered questions in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. A possible candidate for dark matter is a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP). The goal of the Cryogenic Dark matter Search (CDMS) experiment is to develop a detector that has the sensitivity to observe such WIMPs if they exist. The research objective of this project is to improve the background rejection of current and future SuperCDMS detectors by means of significantly improved energy, position, and timing determination. This work will make important contributions to both the current SuperCDMS experiment at Soudan and the design and successful operation of the collaboration's next-generation, 5 kg detectors for a future 100 kg experiment and beyond through the following tasks: i) Development of SuperCDMS detector models from first principles. The PI will model the time structure of the phonon pulses as a function of position, energy, and recoil type to understand the source of discrepancies between their current models and data; and ii) Development of a novel detector characterization and calibration facility to measure phonon pulse shapes and ionization response as a function of event energy, position, and recoil type. This unique mapping of detector response will be used to refine the detector simulation described above as well as provide an exhaustive, empirical data set for defining the background rejection analyses. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the program includes training graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in experimental physics. The technology and methods developed have direct applications in neutrino and X-ray astrophysics as well as broader applications in superconducting detectors with uses in material science and nuclear isotope identification.|2

Muons have important properties compared to electrons and protons when considering a possible next step for a high energy physics facility. Since radiation by muons is much suppressed compared to electrons, it is feasible to consider a relatively compact circular collider in the TeV energy range for muons. However the muon, like the electron, is a point particle and therefore can explore the same physics regime as protons with approximately ten times higher energy. Accordingly the muon collider has attracted increasing interest over the past couple of years. Since the muon is an unstable particle there are many new facets of accelerator physics and technology that need to be examined before one can say with confidence that such a device will work. <br/><br/>The International Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (or MICE) is a high energy physics experiment dedicated to observing ionization cooling of muons for the first time. Such cooling is a necessary step toward a muon collider. Cooling is a process whereby the emittance of a beam is reduced in order to reduce the beam size, so that more muons can be accelerated in smaller aperture accelerators and with fewer focussing magnets. This might enable the construction of high intensity muon accelerators, for example for a Neutrino Factory or Muon Collider, which potentially can attain higher energies than electron-positron colliders. <br/><br/>Researchers looking for a method of cooling muons designed the MICE experiment to test the effectiveness of a technique called ionization cooling. Ionization cooling takes place when muons are sent through an absorber in which they lose momentum via ionization energy loss. They are then reaccelerated in a linear accelerator where their energy is restored only in the forward direction. MICE will use a single particle beam, with not more than one muon passing through the detector about every 10 nanoseconds. The experiment needs to balance the cooling from energy loss with the heating from multiple scattering of the muons.<br/><br/>The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment will make detailed measurements of muon ionization cooling using a newly constructed low-energy muon beam at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL). The experiment is a single particle experiment and utilizes many detector techniques from high energy physics experiments. To characterize and monitor the muon beamline, newly developed scinitillating fiber profile monitors and scintillator paddle rate monitors are employed. In order to monitor the purity of the beam and tag the arrival time of individual muons, a dual aerogel Cherenkov system is used, and a plastic scintillator time-of-flight system will be used.|2

However, due to its short average lifetime (2.2 microseconds), it has not been possible to accelerate a muon beam. A key step in demonstrating the feasibility of muon accelerators is the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE). The main obstacle to accelerating an intense muon beam is that the way such beams are created makes them too large to fit into the vacuum chamber of a synchrotron, and the short muon lifetime leaves little time to shrink the beam. Ionization cooling is a new technique to shrink, or cool a muon beam quickly. The goal of MICE is to build a section of an ionization-cooling channel, instrument it to measure its cooling performance, and use a muon beam produced at a particle accelerator to demonstrate that it works as designed. A collaborative effort of some 150 physicists and engineers from Europe, Asia, and the US, MICE is being mounted at England's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. Construction of the apparatus is currently in progress, and the running of the experiment and analysis of its results is expected to take place during the 3-year period of the grant proposed here. This proposal requests renewal funding for the Illinois Institute of Technology MICE group in support of continued US leadership in muon cooling and in the muon accelerator facilities that might be constructed, in the US or elsewhere, once the feasibility of ionization cooling is demonstrated. The broader impact of this work is most evident in the use of an accelerated muon beam for a Neutrino Factory recognized as the most powerful tool yet conceived in the quest to understand the mysterious oscillatory behavior of the neutrino and its possible role in the evolution of the matter-dominated Universe in which we live. In addition, the pace of MICE development, running, and analysis is particularly well suited to the training of students. MICE will take approximately three years to complete, a good fit to the typical physics student?s graduate training.|2

BBN predictions for cosmic light-element abundances are in broad agreement with observations; this concordance is a major success of the hot big bang model. Moreover, BBN provides a measure of the ordinary matter (""baryon"") content of the universe, as well as total content in relativistic particles (""radiation"") in both visible and invisible form (e.g., neutrinos and any other forms of ""dark light""). In the past decade, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has emerged as a precise and independent measure of cosmic baryons. Comparing BBN and CMB baryon measures thus has provided a new fundamental test of the hot big bang cosmology, and reveal a ""lithium problem."" This BBN/CMB connection is now poised to open qualitatively new possibilities. Recent and upcoming measurements of the CMB for the first time will simultaneously probe not only cosmic baryons, but also cosmic radiation as well as the helium abundance itself. This will enable powerful new tests of cosmology: for the first time, the predictions of BBN can be tested entirely with very precise CMB data. Agreement would dramatically demonstrate the consistency of the standard cosmology, while any difference probes new physics. Professors Fields and Knox will both evaluate and interpret the BBN-CMB comparison, develop tools to efficiently and accurately compare BBN and CMB data. For the first time, a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach will be used to evaluate BBN uncertainties; this will allow a direct and consistent means of combining BBN predictions and CMB data and statistically characterizing the results. As part of this analysis, a new open-source BBN code will be produced, tested, and publicly released.<br/><br/>It is expected that this work will have substantial broader impacts. A publicly available open source BBN code will be released. Moreover, new and strong links will be forged among the CMB and early-universe particle astrophysics communities, and more widely among the particle astrophysics, cosmology, and astronomy communities. Graduate students, both in formal courses in research mentoring, will be trained to synthesize these approaches and to work in an interdisciplinary way. In addition, Profs. Fields will maintain vigorous, sustained outreach programs which include school visits and public lectures bringing this forefront science to a wider audience."|2

What is the mass hierarchy? Do neutrino oscillations violate CP symmetry? Why are the quark and neutrino mixing matrices so different? The value of 13 is central to each of these questions. Its value sets the scale for experiments needed to resolve the mass hierarchy and to search for CP violation. In addition, the size of 13 with respect to the other mixing angles may give insights into the origin of these angles and source of neutrino mass. Reactor experiments hold the promise of unambiguously determining the 13 mixing angle.<br/><br/>This proposal, from the University of Chicago, Columbia University and Barnard College, requests funds to construct the outer muon veto and tagging system for the Double Chooz neutrino oscillation experiment. The goal of the experiment is the measurement of 13 with almost an order-of-magnitude better sensitivity than the current best limit. The veto system is the main detector element used to suppress backgrounds and to understand their systematic uncertainties, which will be essential to reaching the experiment's sensitivity goal. <br/><br/>The Double Chooz Experiment will use two detectors near the Chooz Nuclear Power Station in France. As a result of the few MeV energy of the reactor antineutrinos, cosmogenic backgrounds are a serious issue for reactor experiments. The Double Chooz Experiment uses a two-part, inner-outer veto system to reduce and measure these backgrounds. This group proposes to construct the outer veto, a large-area system of scintillating counters placed above the detector. In addition to providing significant background suppression, the outer veto is expected to be a powerful tool in studying individual backgrounds, particularly the 9Li background which is the dominant background systematic uncertainty.<br/><br/>As for the Broader Impacts of this project, if the Double Chooz experiment demonstrates that 13 is nonzero, searches for CP violation will be particularly compelling. CP violation in the neutrino sector may ultimately help explain the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry in the universe through leptogenesis. Observation of any CP violation in the neutrino sector would be an important clue to one of the most fundamental questions in particle physics.|2

The primary physics goal of CMS is to discover the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking. To that end, the basic philosophy of CMS is to enclose the tracking and calorimetry<br/>inside a strong Solenoidal magnet. This design allows for a Compact design allowing optimal Muon detection without compromise to the electromagnetic calorimetry because of inert material. In general CMS is optimized for detection of electrons, photons, muons, neutrinos and jets. The Standard Model predicts the existence of the Higgs Particle, the missing component of the model. Reconstruction of the Higgs decay modes predicted by theStandard Model requires excellent lepton detection. At the highluminosities to be used at the LHC, the lepton of choice is the muon due to its relatively clean signature. There are about 1500 physicists in the CMS Collaboration who plan to build the detector. The detector is to be constructed from 1998 until data taking in mid 2005. The composition of CMS is roughly 50% physicists from member states, 25% from Russia and other non member states, and 25% US groups. During 1994 a US CMS Collaboration of about 320 physicists and engineers from 40 institutions (4 national labs) was formed. The collective goal of this group is to pursue high energy physics at the highest energy frontier which will be available at LHC.<br/>Their experience on previous hadron collider experiments at Fermilab and CERN and on the R&D associated with the SSC makes it possible for US physicists to have a major impact on the design of CMS.

Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) have similarly caught the attention of physicists and astrophysicists, leading to, among other ideas, postulates of exotic origin based on predictions from particle physics. To make clearer a possible connection between UHECRs and GRBs, one needs to refine our understanding of how the cosmic ray spectrum couples to burst gamma-ray emission. Forging a more robust model of this connection is a principal goal of this proposal. The mandate to do so has been enhanced by the recent confirmation of the existence of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff in the UHECR spectrum at around 6 °? 1019 eV by the Pierre Auger experiment. This project will address how does the relativistic nature of the shocked outflow in bursts influence the prompt emission spectra that was detected in the gamma-ray band. A second question that will be addressed is what is the relative efficiency of accelerating electrons and ions in relativistic shocks thought to be present in GRBs, and how can photon data from these sources be used to probe this efficiency ratio,. Two other questions that will be investigated are whether GRB shocks efficiently generate ion populations up to the extremely high UHECR energies, and what are the anticipated neutrino fluxes from GRBs as potential signals for the IceCube experiment? The broader impacts are that the results will be adapted for display on publicly maintained Web sites. A graduate student will be engaged as an integral part of the work and this student will be involved in teaching at least two lectures per year on gamma-ray bursts in appropriate ndergraduate Rice courses.

This project will develop novel theoretical and observational techniques to test the SNR paradigm. The theoretical studies are based around a common theme: how do cosmic rays modify the structure of the shock? The work will investigate magnetic field amplification, injection and acceleration of CRs, and the role of dust sputtering and the large neutral component in the upstream plasma. Analysis of neutral hydrogen in the so-called Balmer-dominated shocks should lead to a novel way to measure the shock acceleration efficiency.

The main goal of this project is to search for a signature in the energy-dependent composition of the primary cosmic rays of a transition from galactic cosmic rays to a higher energy population of particles from extra-galactic sources. While the primary mission of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is to search for high-energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin by measuring events in the deep detector induced by neutrinos from below, the dominant signal in IceCube is due to downward events caused by cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere. By looking for events from below, IceCube uses the Earth as a shield against this downward background. With its surface component IceTop, IceCube makes a 3-D air shower array with important potential for studying the downward cosmic rays. The novel feature of the IceCube/IceTop air-shower array is its large acceptance for events observed in coincidence. IceTop will use the ratio of the signal in the deep detectors to the signal on the surface to measure the relative concentration of different groups of nuclei in the primary cosmic radiation in an energy range not accessible to direct measurements with satellites because of the low intensity. The angular dependence of showers measured by IceTop alone and other features of the data are also sensitive to primary composition. This gives a complementary sensitivity to composition that in principle will remove some of the model-dependence inherent in the simulations used to interpret the data.

It is currently far from obvious which is the best proxy for the cosmological evolution of the UHECR sources since we are not certain what the sources are. The PI will thus attempt to combine the information from different ultra high and very high energy experiments, including (hopefully) the future detection of very high energy neutrinos, and reach conclusions related to cosmological evolution. The PI proposes theoretical work and data analysis that will lead to a better understanding of the cosmological evolution of different types of powerful extragalactic sources and to identification of the sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECR) - the highest energy nuclei in the Universe. Special attention will be paid to the cosmological evolution of different types of possible sources. The resolution of this evolution dominates the production of secondary fluxes of cosmogenic gamma rays and neutrinos from ultra high energy cosmic rays interactions in the universal photon fields. These include the microwave background and the extragalactic background light (EBL) in infrared, optical and UV ranges. EBL plays important role in the production of the cosmogenic fluxes and in the absorption of TeV gamma rays - both cosmogenic ones as well as of those coming from different extragalactic sources. The comparison of the absorption of the gamma rays coming from different sources may reveal the cosmological evolution of EBL that is now being disputed.<br/>The results of the proposed work will yield information about a much wider range of global astrophysical and cosmological parameters which underscores the broader impact of this work.

The PI, Philip Rubin, will complete his research in charm physics with the CLEO-c collaboration and join in constructing an apparatus at CERN (NA62) to make extremely sensitive measurements of elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix by measuring the decay rate of kaons to pizero-neutrino-neutrino-bar beginning with the charged kaon mode. Both the neutral and charged channels are clean but exacting probes of the Standard Model and of physics beyond this model. In particular, measurements of the rates of these channels will provide great insight into CP-violation, a symmetry breaking that permits the concentration of matter, and therefore the development of life, in the universe. Rubin and his group will work on the critical muon veto system, helping to refurbish NA48's hadron calorimeter and providing the monitoring and controls system. In the past, Rubin has conducted his research almost exclusively with undergraduate students. While continuing his commitment to providing exciting undergraduate experiences in research, his Department's new Ph.D. program, which commenced in Fall 2008, will allow for graduate students to be part of the high energy physics program. His additional outreach efforts are focused on student development and teacher training by developing interdisciplinary courses designed simultaneously to meet University graduation and Virginia state certification requirements.|2

However, these neutrino oscillation data cannot yield the mass scale of neutrinos, nor can they be used to determine that neutrinos are Majorana particles. If the mass of the electron neutrino is ¡Ü 0.2 eV, and neutrinos are Majorana particles, neutrino-less double beta decay is the only hope of determining the mass scale and it is the only practical experiment for determining that they are Majorana particles. Knowledge of the mass would determine what role, if any, neutrinos play as Hot Dark Matter candidates, and if they are Majorana particles, this opens the door to leptogenesis as a possible mechanism for the tiny particle over anti-particle asymmetry in the early universe that would have led to the particle dominated universe observed today.<br/><br/>Hence, CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events), as a neutrino-less double beta decay experiment, has significant discovery potential. This proposal is a request to support the University of South Carolina (USC) in: 1) the first phase of the construction of the 130-Te CUORE experiment; the USC group proposes to take responsibility for the production of the electronic components necessary to instrument the 988 TeO2 bolometers; and 2) an R&D program to determine the technical feasibility and cost of constructing CUORE with Te enriched to 85% in 130-Te. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project relate to development of ultralow background Ge detectors, transferred now to commercial companies. The low background technology has been used to produce an ultra low background Ge detector for the Savannah River Low-Background Counting Facility. This facility is used for US government work related to Homeland Defense and National Defense.|2

It will provide funds to work on the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina. The Observatory is the world's largest detector for ""ultra-high energy"" cosmic rays. The data promises to shed light on the origin of these cosmic rays, the highest energy particles of the (known) Universe. The measured energy spectrum of cosmic rays extends up to eleven orders of magnitude greater than the equivalent rest mass of the proton. No single source or source class is expected to be responsible for the flux over such a wide range of energies. The large energies of these particles imply that they are accelerated in violent processes in extreme astrophysical objects, for example Active Galactic Nuclei, which contain supermassive black holes, or Gamma Ray Bursts. With its major involvement in IceCube and in neutrino physics and phenomenology, UW-Madison is a natural place to explore the possibilities of the Pierre Auger Observatory as a neutrino detector, and to further study the connection between cosmic rays and neutrinos. <br/><br/>The PI's areas of particular strength and interest are the search for discrete sources and anisotropies in the cosmic ray arrival direction distribution and the search for neutrinos at ultra-high energies.

Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are possible candidates. It is expected that the discovery and understanding of WIMP dark matter will require very large target masses. This award will support work on the MiniCLEAN detector, a single-phase detector designed to scale to large detector masses. MiniCLEAN follows the example of neutrino experiments where a monolithic target volume is surrounded by photomuliplier tubes, and the primary rejection of external backgrounds comes from the self-shielding made possible by the sheer size of the detector. This approach detects recoiling nuclei from WIMP interactions in liquid argon using only scintillation light. The simplicity of the single-phase technique allows for the construction of very large mass detectors at relatively low cost. The MiniCLEAN detector is presently under construction at SNOLAB. MIT has been involved in multiple aspects of the MiniCLEAN experiment, including the design and fabrication of muon veto system, the design and fabrication of the neutron calibration system, simulation and verification of the neutron background model, and preparation for data analysis. This award will support the MIT group's involvement in commissioning and operation of MiniCLEAN, and the subsequent data analysis.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: The MiniCLEAN experiment will provide training for students and postdocs. The MIT group actively participates in the MIT-sponsored Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), which provides a forum for undergraduates to participate in experimental research.|2

The detectors will be operated at the DUSEL 7400 foot level within a cryogenic, shielded apparatus designed to provide a zero-background raw exposure of 4.5 ton year over 4 years. <br/><br/>The award, through a Cooperative Agreement, will fund the California Institute of Technology and collaborators to produce a Preliminary Design for such an experiment to be constructed and run at the DUSEL underground laboratory. The case is made that (1) recent technical innovations improvements are a moderate risk evolution from current performance and thus are largely an engineering effort appropriate to the DUSEL S4 solicitation; (2) prior efforts on CDMS and SuperCDMS provide empirically verified technical performance and cost baselines, placing these estimates on a solid foundation; and (3) the team undertaking this effort has a proven strong track record of such evolutionary gains in background reduction, background rejection, increased target mass, and scientific reach. Because of these characteristics, GEODM provides an extremely promising path to significant gains in WIMP sensitivity or to detailed study of a possible WIMP signal at DUSEL. Further, the CDMS collaboration has contributed many novel technologies now in use by other groups and in other fields. GEODM will address the cost challenges of cryogenic detectors, which will likely broaden even further their use (e.g., for homeland security). Dark matter research provides students and postdocs with a diverse education and range of career avenues, as evidenced by the recent granting of six PhDs based on CDMS II work and the impressive number of former students and postdocs now in faculty and senior level laboratory positions. <br/><br/>The future of germanium technology in dark matter searches, and in the search for neutrinoless double-beta decay, rests on the development of time and resource-saving techniques for detector production.|2

Because no solar models have yet been developed that are adequately able to both predict the observed level of neutrinos and yet account for all the other observed features of the sun, the possibility of neutrino oscillations has been invoked as an explanation for the measured deficit of one species.

This photodetector compresses the phase space of the incident photons, and amplifies them ? a Light Amplifier Compressor (LAC) tube. <br/><br/>The technology is based on proven techniques used in image intensifiers, and on the experience of a pre-prototype already constructed by the proposers. Photoelectrons are accelerated to a phosphor screen, and the resulting light is collected by wavelength-shifting (WLS) optical fibers. Because the photoelectron trajectories at the phosphor screen are not critical, high collection efficiency and nearly isochronous photoelectron arrivals result. Two configurations are considered, one with a planar photocathode, proximity focused to a planar phosphor screen anode, and readout by WLS fibers behind the screen. The other is a cylindrical photocathode, radially focused onto a much smaller cylindrical hollow coaxial phosphor anode, readout by WLS fibers coaxially inserted into the center of the anode cylinder. <br/><br/>Compared with spherical-type PMTs, the vacuum volume for a comparable photocathode area is much reduced, and the vacuum envelope is amenable to much higher external pressures. For a mega-tonne-class neutrino or nucleon decay detector, a 20-30 cm diameter by 1-2 m long cylindrical Optical Compressor Amplifier might be contemplated, readout by a pair of mm diameter pixel detectors, with ~40 cm spatial resolution along the axis. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts include photon detection applications where low power and/or compactness are essential at the site of detection. Such applications include space and satellite applications, CT scanners, gamma cameras, and fluorescence instruments. At least six students are anticipated to participate in this work.

These external backgrounds, particularly fast neutrons and cosmogenic radioactivity from muon-induced processes, must be eliminated for underground experiments in pursuit of double beta decay, searches for dark matter candidates, and oscillations of low-energy neutrinos. <br/><br/>This award will provide funds to measure such backgrounds with liquid scintillator, sodium iodide and germanium detectors. The results from such measurements will enable the experiments to be placed at different levels according to their designed sensitivity and shielding requirements. Measuring muon-induced neutron flux at the 300-ft level will enable one to benchmark Monte Carlo simulation codes for all incoming experiments. Measuring and understanding high energy neutron excitation of the shielding and detector materials for neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments are crucial for interpreting results and establishing shielding requirements. On the other hand, measuring partial gamma-ray cross sections provides useful data for benchmarking Monte Carlo simulation. These funds will provide the support needed to analyze existing data sets and to take more data.<br/><br/>Among the broader impacts, it is noted that characterizing the DUSEL site is also useful to other DUSEL experiments, such as the underground nuclear astrophysics accelerator program and proton decay experiments.

A precision measurement of the spectrum and rate of these neutrinos is one of the three high priority goals defined by the 2004 APS Neutrino Matrix report, among others. These measurements will provide a fundamental test of our current model of neutrino oscillations, an important constraint on non-standard processes in stars such as our Sun, and open a new window on very low energy neutrino interactions which may lead to unexpected discoveries.<br/><br/>This proposal requests funds to develop a novel detector that will allow a real-time measurement of very low energy solar neutrinos, down to a few keV, with excellent spatial and energy resolution in large volumes (more than a ton), using a time projection technique. The detector uses the cryogenic fluids neon and helium as the detection medium, in which ?electron bubbles? form along the track of a recoil electron produced by a neutrino interaction in the detector. These electron bubbles are drifted in an electric field to an array of Gas Electron Multipliers, where they are amplified and optically detected with commercial CCD cameras. <br/><br/>Education and Outreach have been a major emphasis of this R&D program since its inception.

These experiments seek to study the fundamental laws of physics, such as our understanding of how the sun shines, whether the neutrino is its own antiparticle, and what is the dark matter pervading the universe. However, to take full advantage of the shielding from cosmic rays, these experiments must be built from components with such low levels of radioactivity that even the best screening facilities available in shielded sites at the Earth's surface are insufficiently sensitive. New screening facilities must be built underground to allow these low-background experiments to succeed. <br/><br/>This proposal seeks resources to build a detector that would be the world's most sensitive screener of radioactive surface contamination such as low-energy-electron emitting radioisotopes. This detector, dubbed the ""BetaCage,"" will consist of an ultra-low-background multi-wire proportional chamber using neon gas at atmospheric pressure. This screener would have applications for rare-interaction physics experiments and trace radioactive counting applications. The BetaCage would detect electron rates low enough for the 150 kg stage of SuperCDMS to reach its design sensitivity for WIMP dark matter without being limited by misidentified low-energy electrons. <br/><br/>The BetaCage would also be ideal for screening alphas, with important applications for dark matter searches, solar neutrino experiments, and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, as well as for the Si-chip industry and for other scientific fields, many of general societal interest. Additional broader impacts will include the training of scientists in radiation-detection technologies and low-background techniques."|2

Noble gases are an attractive medium for particle detectors due to their low ionization potential, high scintillation efficiency, long electron lifetime and low cost. These detectors are currently employed to address a wide variety of fundamental physics questions, including neutrinoless double beta decay, neutrino oscillations, rare muon decays, dark matter searches and solar neutrinos. Many of these questions are central to the scientific mission of an underground lab and similar detectors have been proposed for the initial suite of experiments at DUSEL. <br/><br/>Most liquid detectors to date are of relatively modest size, with target masses ranging from a few kilograms to a few hundred kilograms. However, next-generation experiments are poised to push the boundaries far beyond the current state of the art. For an experiment to succeed in this new regime, it will be necessary to purify the cryogenic liquids far beyond what current technologies have achieved. For existing TPC-style detectors, the concentration of electronegative impurities must be less than about 100 ppt oxygen equivalent to avoid attenuation of the charge signal as it drifts through the detector volume. Therefore, the next set of experiments will require impurity concentrations from one to ten ppt, or free electron lifetimes from tens to hundreds of milliseconds. <br/><br/>This award will enable the group to develop a new method for detecting extremely low concentrations of impurities, with the potential to extend current sensitivities by several orders of magnitude. <br/><br/>As part of the Broader Impacts of this work, this impurity detector would find wide application for many of the fundamental physics experiments which are likely to be hosted by DUSEL. In addition, this work will also have significantly broader impact by serving to further the education of graduate students.|2

The Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) will explore new physics at extremely short distances not accessible to accelerator experiments. Specifically, the proposed proton stability experiments at DUSEL, along with a new generation of experiments at HyperK, MEMPHYS, ICARUS, and LENA, will either discover proton decay or at the very least put new limits on proton lifetimes which would be an order of magnitude or more better than the current limits. In view of the huge effort that will go into these experiments it is incumbent on theorists to delineate more clearly the prediction for the proton lifetime in various models, compute the branching ratios and provide criteria for discrimination among models that survive the SuperK limits. Current analyses on proton lifetime could be improved on two fronts. First, the detailed branching ratios for many models have not been worked out and, second, new effort is needed in reducing uncertainties in absolute prediction rates. <br/><br/>This award will provide funding for studies to fill in these gaps and provide the experimentalists with testable predictions of proton decay for a variety of unified models. They will investigate a new class of SO(10) models based on a unified Higgs sector for which proton decay has thus far not been calculated. <br/><br/>Among broader impacts, it is proposed to investigate the correlations between proton stability, neutrino masses, and dark matter consistent with WMAP data. These theoretical efforts are essential for the analysis and interpretation of data from the proposed new generation of proton stability experiments at DUSEL and elsewhere, and it is only with such effort that the maximum benefit from the proposed experiments can accrue.|2

Observations indicate that 80% of the matter in the Universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary Dark Matter particles that do not emit or absorb light. The leading hypothesis for the nature of dark matter is that it consists of new elementary particles produced moments after the Big Bang, generally referred to as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. One way to detect them in an Earth-bound experiment is to measure the low energy nuclear recoils they produce in rare interactions with normal matter. This group will develop small NaI and liquid xenon detectors that can be installed in the Solar Neutrino Borexino detector, at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory, Italy, for a dark matter search. <br/><br/>The detector would be inserted through existing plumbing tubes into the center of the Borexino liquid scintillator. When positioned in the Borexino scintillator, the background in the small detector due to external sources of gamma rays and neutrons will be negligible. The Borexino scintillator also serves as a very efficient anti-coincidence detector to veto internal gamma and neutron backgrounds that originate and scatter within the small detector and in the Borexino scintillator. A 10-kg detector with the combination of low backgrounds from external and internal sources should have sufficient sensitivity to test the validity of the reported DAMA/LIBRA dark matter signal. <br/><br/>For Broader Impacts, this proposal addresses one of the major scientific questions of our time, the nature of dark matter in the universe. As a cross-disciplinary topic it also has an impact on advanced detector technology. The PI has a commitment to involving undergraduates in his research projects.|2

The Lab is hosted in a Minnesota State Park, where each year about 4,000 of the Park?s visitors venture 2,341 feet underground to see the facility, the MINOS and CDMS-II experiments, and to learn about neutrinos and Dark Matter. Support is requested to continue the successful program which has been in place since the MINOS detector was completed in 2003. The Soudan Underground Mine is a historical site operated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in an old iron mine in Northern Minnesota. Around 28,000 people per year take the ?historical? tour in the park, visiting the workings at the bottom of the ½-mile deep mine. The Laboratory is also on that lowest level of the mine, where experiments benefit from the 10**5 reduction in the cosmic ray background compared to the Earth?s surface. <br/><br/>This proposal is centered on the broader impact, but the outreach program described here has a significant impact on, and supports the intellectual merit of, the underlying science program. The coincidence of an established education and outreach program, a top-notch research facility, and an unusual and impressive location provide a great opportunity to bring students and the general public into the lab where they learn about the often esoteric world of particle physics in an intriguing and accessible fashion. They also propose to fund an annual Open House at Vermillion Community College in nearby Ely, MN. This will help give the lab a high and positive profile in the community as well as bring the science to even more people.|2

The PI will approach these outstanding questions in particle physics by constructing various candidate models for beyond the standard model physics and by examining the experimental consequences of these models at the LHC and in underground experiments for proton decays and neutrinos. New data from Collider experiments will be utilized to guide the construction of models that solve the gauge hierarchy problem, including those with Supersymmetry, extra dimensions and <br/>a strongly coupled Higgs sector. Methods to analyze the data distinguish between competing models will be developed. Properties of the neutrinos and implications for proton decays in these models will be analyzed. The results of these studies may point to the right route to the further unification of GUT and the family symmetries. Novel origins of CP violation in extra dimensions or in a strongly coupled Higgs sector will be searched for, and their implications for leptogenesis will be studied. The outcome of this investigation willhopefully shed light on the origin of the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter in the Universe. Possible connections between the mechanism behind the electroweak symmetry breaking and the dynamics for flavor mixing will be investigated. <br/>The broader impacts of this research are to promote the public interests in and appreciations for the upcoming exciting results in particle physics, through an active participation of the PI in the UC Irvine's Quark Net Program.

Csaba Csaki, Yuval Grossman, Toichiro Kinoshita, Peter Lepage, Liam McAllister and Maxim Perelstein at Cornell University. <br/><br/>The investigators propose to study some of the most important and exciting topics in a variety of fields within high-energy theory, including particle physics in and beyond the Standard Model, collider physics, string theory, and cosmology. Research on the Standard Model (SM) consists of investigations of flavor and neutrino physics, lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and precision quantum electrodynamics (QED). Beyond the Standard Model, explorations of diverse models of the TeV scale are proposed, together with studies of the new collider physics techniques necessary for testing them. Investigations of aspects of dark matter physics are also proposed. Within string theory the primary focus is on understanding the effective theories arising in string compactifications, and exploring the implications of string theory for cosmology. Intellectual merit: The Cornell particle theory group carries out state-of-the-art research in nearly every major area of modern particle theory. The unifying theme of the group's research program is a distinctive focus on theoretical problems that are relevant for present and future experiments, including the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the intensity frontier program, dark matter searches, and cosmic microwave background experiments. The proposed research is directed at maximizing the scientific impact of these experiments. The most important recent development in particle physics is the historic discovery of the Higgs(-like) boson, as part of the wealth of data produced by the 2010-2012 runs of the LHC. Professors Csaki, Grossman and Perelstein will focus their attention over the next five years on physics related to current and future colliders. Csaki will explore unconventional supersymmetric models that are still viable in light of the LHC data; alternative Higgs models, including a Higgslike dilaton and the composite Higgs; and other TeV-scale models consistent with LHC results. Grossman will explore the physics that is relevant to the intensity frontier program in the near and more distant future. This includes charm and beauty physics, charge-parity (CP) violation, and the study of neutrino physics. Perelstein's research plans include using the new window on TeV-scale physics provided by the 125 GeV boson to glean new information about possible physics beyond the Standard Model; understanding the implications of the direct LHC searches for new physics, focusing in particular on naturalness issues; and proposing new LHC searches motivated by both theoretical and experimental developments. In parallel, Perelstein proposes to continue to contribute to theoretical interpretations of dark matter searches, where several interesting hints of detection have already been reported, and much more data will soon become available. Professor Lepage, as a leading member of the ""High Precision QCD"" (HPQCD) lattice gauge theory collaboration, will continue the pursuit of high-precision results for heavy quark physics from lattice gauge theory, obtaining semileptonic D-meson form factors for charm physics; extending b-quark results to the same precision (of order 1%) as the charm observables; and determining the quark masses and the strong coupling constant to high precision. Professor Kinoshita has devoted the past decade to a systematic evaluation of the five-loop QED contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) of the electron. In the next few years, he proposes to improve the numerical evaluation of his group's analytic results. Professor McAllister plans to investigate the physics of the very early universe, using cosmological observations of ultraviolet-sensitive quantities to shed light on theories of quantum gravity. McAllister's primary focus will be understanding inflationary dynamics in compactifications of string theory, but he also proposes to study the vacuum structure of non-supersymmetric string compactifications. <br/><br/>Broader impact: The Cornell particle theory group puts a high priority on the training of graduate students and postdocs, as well as on the wide dissemination of recent research results to the general public. Over the past three years, the group graduated twelve students, a majority of whom are now postdocs, while eight of our former students who graduated over the past decade now have faculty positions in the U.S. or abroad. Every member of the group is vigorously pursuing all possibilities for outreach to the general public. Numerous public talks, articles, colloquia, high school lectures and teacher conferences have been produced in the past, and will continue to be organized in the future by the group members."|2

Another significant challenge is to communicate the excitement and value of scientific research beyond the traditional research community. This project addresses these issues by developing an intensive laboratory component for an innovative intermediate astrophysics class that targets physics, secondary education science, and non-science students. It uses collaborative working groups to engage this diverse collection of students in active learning that starts with modest, easily constructed detectors and builds to sophisticated instrumentation based on cosmic ray research at the South Pole.

Results from neutrino oscillation experiments have provided compelling evidence that neutrinos have mass and give the first indication that the Standard Model of nuclear and particle physics is incomplete. With the realization that neutrinos are massive, there is an increased interest in investigating their intrinsic properties. Understanding the neutrino mass generation mechanism, the neutrino character (Majorana or Dirac), the absolute neutrino mass scale, and the neutrino mass spectrum are some of the main focuses of the immediate future's neutrino experiments. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this award is based on the fact that a sensitive search for the neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay is the only practical way to determine if neutrinos are Majorana particles (their own antiparticles). This exotic decay is the most sensitive test of lepton-number conservation, which is an important symmetry in elementary particle physics. With the goal of ultimately realizing a 1-tonne scale neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay experiment using Germanium (Ge) detectors, the Majorana collaboration is assembling a prototype referred to as the Demonstrator that is intended to confirm that background levels low enough to justify such a large experiment can be reached. The baseline plan for the Demonstrator is for 15 kg of Ge detectors fabricated from Ge enriched in the double-beta isotope 76-Ge. Because most of the cost of such an experiment is the apparatus associated with it and not enriched Ge, and because one can increase the mass of instrumented 76-Ge significantly without increasing that base cost, there is the opportunity to ""increase"" the physics reach of the project for a reasonable, incremental additional cost. This award provides support for extra Ge detectors fabricated from enriched material to improve the physics reach.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The technology of larger, lower-background HPGe arrays developed from a tonne-scale experiment can be expected to enable a new generation of highly efficient, ultra-low-background gamma spectroscopy measurements. Among the fields that stand to benefit from this new generation of technology are: direct dark matter searches; measurements for environmental monitoring; atmospheric, ocean, and groundwater environmental transport; methods of radioactive dating; reactor monitoring; bioassay for determining very low occupational exposures to radiation; and biological studies involving radiotracers at very low activities.

In these experiments<br/>a new state of matter-the quark gluon plasma- will be formed. This state prevailed when the<br/>Universe was younger than a microsecond with temperatures larger than 1012 K. This novel state<br/>is also conjectured to exist at the core of the densest stars in the Universe-neutron stars- and to be<br/>the primary constituent of hypothetical quark stars. The density in these astrophysical objects is<br/>about 1015gr/cc, these stars are the remnant of the most powerful events in the present Universesupernovae<br/>explosions. The properties of neutron stars and the existence of quark stars is currently<br/>being studied by a host of satellite missions: HST, Rosat, Chandra, XMM-Newton and forthcoming<br/>neutrino telescopes.<br/>Assessing potential observables and experimental signatures of the quark gluon plasma requires<br/>studying the strong interactions in an unprecedented regime of temperatures and densities. Furthermore,<br/>in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions the quark gluon plasma is expected to be a transient<br/>state with an unprecedented short lifetime of the order of 10-22 seconds, undergoing a phase transition<br/>to a phase in which quarks and gluons are con.ned inside hadrons. Thus the challenge is to<br/>extract observational signatures fromthe short-lived and rapidly evolving plasma. The focus and<br/>goal of this proposal is to implement the methods that we developed during the last several years<br/>to study equilibriumand non-equilibriumexp erimental signatures of the quark gluon plasma and<br/>the phase transitions in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions and in compact stars. In particular<br/>we focus on: i) electromagnetic signatures (photons and lepton pairs), ii) transport phenomena<br/>and properties of .uctuations as potential observables of the phase transitions, iii) astrophysical<br/>processes that lead to observational signals of quark matter in strongly magnetized neutron stars<br/>and quark stars: photon and neutrino emissions.<br/>Intellectual challenge: This is a truly interdisciplinary programat the forefront of nuclear<br/>and particle physics and astrophysics and cosmology. Many of the methods, in particular transport<br/>phenomena strongly out of equilibrium also overlaps with timely problems in condensed matter<br/>physics: femtosecond relaxation in semiconductors. Thus we expect that the program will also<br/>have a broad impact in many areas. The possibility of opening a window to the Early Universe<br/>with earth-bound accelerators and studying the densest stars, the remnants of the most energetic<br/>events in the Universe-Supernovae explosions-is clearly one of the most fascinating endeavors.<br/>Broad interest: The appeal of studying the Early Universe and some of the most exotic<br/>objects in the present Universe goes beyond the scientists working in these areas, and reaches to<br/>the broad audience. The general public is fascinated about the latest discoveries in cosmology and<br/>particle physics, and eager to listen and learn more. The symbiosis between cosmology, astrophysics<br/>and nuclear and particle physics lends itself to being an e.ective vehicle to transmit the new and<br/>fascinating discoveries and to highlight the importance of the di.erent areas to unravel the ultimate<br/>mysteries of the Universe.<br/>The projects described in this proposal are a continuation of the research done under the<br/>previous Grant: N.S.F. PHY-9988720 (5/31/00-5/31/03) and is estimated for a period of three<br/>years.|2

The discovery of neutrino oscillations can be regarded as the first window provided by experiments on physics beyond the standard model. The search for neutrino less double beta decay represents the next step in this exciting field of physics and provides an opportunity to perform transformational science addressing universal topics such as the origin of mass, the role of Dirac?s equation in describing spin half fermions and connections between particle physics and cosmology. Many experiments tackled the double beta decay over the last thirty years, setting half-life limits for this mode of the order of 10**25 years, corresponding to a Majorana neutrino mass just below 1 eV. A new generation of much larger experiments will push this sensitivity to 10**28 years or Majorana masses below 10 meV, exploring much of the parameter space compatible with the oscillation results. Those searches require tones of specific isotopes that, in order to result in viable measurements, must be produced by isotopic enrichment. They also require unprecedented reductions of radioactive backgrounds and substantial attenuation of the cosmic ray flux, making their location deep underground imperative. <br/><br/>This proposal plans to establish the engineering and project management infrastructure to design a full scale double beta decay experiment, the ?Enriched Xenon Observatory? (EXO), using a few tons of the isotope Xenon 136. The isotope choice capitalizes on the relative simplicity of xenon enrichment and purification and on its versatility as a detection medium in a liquid or gas phase Time Projection Chamber. The substantial investment in isotopic enrichment can, in this way, result in more than one detector, making it possible to cross check results and upgrade detectors as new technologies become available. In addition a scheme being developed by the EXO collaboration to tag the atomic final state of the decay has the promise of drastically reducing radioactivity backgrounds. Data soon to be collected with EXO-200 will provide very important input for the design work on a multi-ton detector for DUSEL. <br/><br/>The broader impact plan of the EXO collaboration is to develop a cross-disciplinary program involving the techniques ranging from nuclear/particle detector physics to AMO and surface science. Therefore many intermediate results may have spin-offs in a broad range of fields. EXO R&D has trained students in a variety of disciplines and a vibrant outreach program at several EXO institutions brings the excitement of science to grade school students and to high school teachers who spend their summer in some of our labs. As part of this proposal we plan to enhance this last component, by connecting it with the DUSEL outreach program.|2

This work is organized around the following four questions:<br/><br/>What is the origin of the spin of the proton? Experiments show that, contrary to expectation, the quark spins carry a small fraction of the total. Gluons, the carriers of the strong force, and the orbital motion of quarks inside the proton are the only other possibilities. We use high-energy polarized proton-proton collisions at the Brookhaven National Laboratory to measure the gluon contribution to the proton spin and also search for information on the quark's orbital motion.<br/><br/>Why is more matter than antimatter left over after the end of the Big Bang? Matter and antimatter in the expansion of the universe are created and annihilated in equal amounts unless processes exist which depend on the direction of time. Time reversal violation also gives rise to the spontaneous separation of positive and negative electric charge along the spin axis of fundamental particles. Searches for such a separation are underway using an electric field to induce a bulk matter magnetization in a garnet crystal and to precess the spin axis of neutrons captured in a liquid helium bath.<br/><br/>What are the properties and interactions of neutrinos? These elusive particles formed during nuclear and particle decay can change in flight from one type to another. New data at low energies from the MiniBooNE detector at Fermilab seem to indicate that such changes do not fit into the standard pattern established by the number of known quarks and leptons. Work to compare neutrino and anti-neutrino effects and measure neutrino-induced reactions is underway. We will also check to see if neutrinos are their own anti-particles.<br/><br/>How strong are the parts of the weak force? This force causes nuclear beta decay and other nuclear reactions that violate mirror symmetry. Experiments are in preparation to search for mirror-asymmetry in the photons from neutron-proton capture and for a corkscrew motion of neutron spins as they travel through liquid helium. We also propose to measure the lifetime and decay properties of the neutron itself.<br/><br/>We share the knowledge gained by this work and our experiences in scientific research through Open Houses, laboratory tours, science café discussions, and news items in the local public media. We strive to awaken the interest of students in the local school system in science by visiting science classes, conducting career presentations, judging science fair projects, participating in events at the Science Olympiad, and performing physics demonstrations at the Indiana State Fair. We prepare the next generation of scientists, educators, and technically-trained people for industry by educating post-doctoral research assistants, graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students. We organize summer schools for nuclear physics and its various specialties. With the resources available at a laboratory with its own suite of accelerators, we also provide new detectors and experimental technologies that expand the research possibilities across the nation in ways that are beyond the reach of many university departments. We share this technology base with a proton beam cancer treatment facility at the IU Health Proton Therapy Center, which has treated more than 1000 patients with a staff composed in part of our former students and postdocs.|2

The program covers activities in 9 major programs: ATLAS, MiniBooNE, D0, Pierre Auger, HiRes, Reactor Experiment, NuTeV, ZEUS, and eBubble. These research programs address six of the nine interrelated questions raised by the recent Quantum Universe report that lays out the path ahead for particle physics. <br/><br/>Despite the profound understanding of the fundamental laws and particles achieved in the last 30 years, there remain fundamental unanswered questions about our universe: What is the nature of the universe and its composition? What are matter, energy, space and time? How did we get here and where are we going? How do cosmic accelerators work? If there are new symmetries or physical laws, one must look beyond the Standard Model through precision measurements and at the energy frontier. This research program does that. Supersymmetry may be observed at the Tevatron with D0, and should be observed at the CERN LHC with ATLAS. The mystery of dark energy may be related to the Higgs field, which may be discovered at the LHC. If there are extra dimensions to space, they too may be accessible at the LHC. The research program will also address the question of the nature of fundamental particles, and through precision measurements probe higher energy scales: top quarks (D0, ATLAS), Bs mesons (D0), protons (ZEUS), neutrinos (BooNE, NuTeV, Reactor), and sparticles (ATLAS). Sparticles could yield candidates for dark matter. In the area of neutrino physics, there are many unanswered questions: How many neutrinos are there? Can we measure CP violation now that we know they have mass and oscillate? These are questions to be addressed by MiniBooNE and eventually a Reactor Experiment. As we look back to the early universe, accelerators will be used to understand the electroweak phase transition (ATLAS). <br/><br/>At the intersection of particle physics and astronomy, the HiRes and Auger experiments will study the very highest energy particles seen in the universe that are to this day poorly understood. What is the composition of these ultra high energy cosmic rays? What are their sources and how are they accelerated? <br/><br/>The Columbia University Nevis Labs groups plan to continue to build on their very successful programs in education and outreach. The goal is to engage the full educational spectrum from high school students, high school teachers, undergraduates and the general public in understanding and doing high energy physics. A primary emphasis of the Columbia programs is to target underrepresented groups to participate in these activities.

Work on two other future projects is also proposed: the new MicroBooNE and NuSOnG experiments. Particle physics considers a vast range of questions, from subatomic to cosmic scales. It is expected that new physics beyond the Standard Model will hold the key to making progress in our understanding. Some of the most important questions are: How do we explain the large disparity between the weak scale, the grand-unification scale and the Planck scale? What is the dark matter and dark energy in the universe? What is responsible for the large matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe; is it related to CP violation for the neutrinos? Why are the neutrino masses so small? <br/><br/>This award provides funds to support this group in the following research program: top quarks (D0, ATLAS), neutrinos (BooNE, Double Chooz), and sparticles (ATLAS). These last particles could yield candidates for dark matter. The neutrino sector has many unanswered questions: How many are there? Can we measure CP violation now that we know they have mass and oscillate? These are questions that are being answered by the MiniBooNE experiment and, in the future, by Double Chooz. In addition, precision neutrino experiments like NuSOnG will examine if the neutrinos have unexpected properties that give them a special place among the other particles. <br/><br/>The Columbia groups place a high priority on education and outreach and plan to build on their past very successful efforts by integrating a number of these activities into the ongoing research.

The electromagnetic and weak interactions, though unified in phenomena at high energies and in the first moments after the Big Bang, appear at lower energies to be quite distinct. The Standard Model of fundamental interactions and constituents of matter builds in this symmetry breaking through the Higgs boson. One strand of the proposed research is the search for the Higgs boson. Another strand of the proposed studies seeks evidence for phenomena that will show how the Standard Model is modified, and help illuminate the more comprehensive theory. These aspects of symmetry breaking will be explored through work in the D0 (at Fermilab) and ATLAS (at CERN) experiments. The proposal also outlines a new participation in the KOPIO experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory, aimed at the measurement of a rare neutral kaon decay (to a neutral pion, neutrino and anti-neutrino). This would not occur unless there were a lack of symmetry between our world and one in which particles are replaced by antiparticles and viewed in a mirror (CP symmetry). The observation of a deviation from the value predicted by the Standard Model will signal that new non-standard mechanisms are at play in CP-violation, and should aid in understanding the origin of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the research will occur at several levels: (a) Understanding how matter is constructed and how the forces of nature shape it into the myriad observed forms is a long standing question that resonates with scientists and non-scientists alike; (b) The research program poses a set of questions through which students and postdoctoral fellows will learn not only to frame crisp tests of the fundamental construction of matter, but also to devise innovative methods and tools for conducting them. Attacking such problems provides the rigorously educated young people that our society desperately needs; and (c) the proposal includes elements of outreach to the broader community.|2

By directly observing dark matter particles in our detectors, we will be able to determine the nature of the particles that make up to 83% of the mass of the universe. These studies will offer a unique window on physics beyond the Standard Model, and are complementary to searches for New Physics at the Large Hadron Collider. Direction-sensitive Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) detectors will provide the most convincing evidence for direct observation of dark matter due to their excellent background rejection capabilities. The correlation between the energy and length of the recoil track allows for a powerful rejection of backgrounds due to photons, electrons, and alpha particles. In addition, the correlation between the measured direction of the nuclear recoil and the expected direction of the dark matter wind allows for an efficient rejection of more insidious backgrounds, such as neutrons and solar neutrinos. Finally, directionality can discriminate between various dark matter halo models in our Galaxy, making directional detectors unique observatories for underground WIMP astronomy.<br/><br/>This award will provide funding to construct a detector that measures the direction of the WIMP particles as well as their recoil energy, to provide an unambiguous observation of dark matter, even in the presence of backgrounds. The detector proposed is DMTPCino, a 1 cubic meter, low-pressure time projection chamber (TPC) with optical readout. <br/><br/>The technology can be used for several applications outside particle physics, such as neutron detection for homeland security and defense applications, to scan for potentially hazardous materials through the emission of fission-spectrum neutrons. Applications of the DMTPC principle as an imaging device for medical and biological applications are also under study.

The proposed work falls into three categories; Inter-Nucleon Interactions and RG Methods, ab-initio Calculations of Finite Nuclei and Infinite Nuclear Matter, and Microscopically-Based Energy Density Functionals (EDFs) for Nuclei. The central goals of the proposed research are to study how renormalization group and effective field theory methods can be used to extend ab-initio calculations to medium-mass nuclei and beyond; to construct microscopically-based nuclear energy density functionals (EDFs) with improved predictive power away from known data; and to develop non-perturbative methods to provide controlled calculations of shell model (SM) effective Hamiltonians and effective operators for large-scale shell model applications (e.g., neutrinoless double beta decay). The projects in all three areas are intimately connected to fundamental questions in nuclear theory such as: What are the limits of nuclear stability? What are the masses of neutrinos?, and How do the properties of nuclei and nuclear matter emerge from underlying two- and three-nucleon (and higher) interactions? The proposed research will play an integral role in the development of model-independent few- and many-body calculations with controlled theoretical uncertainties, which will be crucial to provide theoretical guidance for rare isotope beam facilities and astrophysical applications. <br/><br/>This project will have broader impacts by fostering inter-disciplinary connections and helping to build a strong and youthful scientific community in the United States. The complementary techniques of Effective Field Theory and the Renormalization Group are widely used in many areas of theoretical physics due to their universality and power of simplification. Therefore, our use of these modern and general techniques will enhance interactions with other disciplines such as condensed matter, atomic, and high energy theory. Similarly, the use of coupled-cluster and energy density functional methods for nuclei in this work will foster connections with quantum chemistry. Finally, the current project will provide graduate students and postdocs with a good balance of formal(analytical) and practical (numerical) work, which will serve as excellent preparation for a career in industry or academia.|2

This spectacular result suggests that neutrinos have novel properties beyond the standard model of particle physics, a basic question of present-day science that had remained unanswered for the better part of this century.With the door to new physics just opened, neutrino physics and astrophysics are assured to be in focus of the scientific community for years to come. Our series of conferences proposes to address the basic open issues in astrophysics and cosmology with a special emphasis on the leading theoretical ideas beyond the present Standart Model of particle physics and to promote those theoretical cross-links between different aspects of neutrino physics and astrophysics which naturallly arise at the present time in this fast-developing field. It will address the particle and nuclear physics aspects of neutrinos as well as the fascinating role they play in cosmology and astrophysics.Our proposed series will come at a very strategic time when actual discoveries in the field of neutrino physics from the new generation of underground experiments are already starting to change the shape of our picture of the Universe. For the first of our proposed meetings it is likely that data from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory will already be available and these, together first results from new CMBR measurements, could have a far-reaching impact. For the second meeting we envisage to have the first results from the Borexino and other relevant experiments, which should shed new light on the solar neutrino problem.

These are two of the five highest priority experiments identified in recommendations by a recent NSAC review of the field. The physics has broad impact across the fields of nuclear and particle physics and astrophysics. Both efforts enjoy strong collaborations and the support of the community as well as the scrutiny of critical reviews. The University of Michigan group has key technical and leadership roles in both efforts. <br/><br/>At NIST, we will perform an absolute calibration of the neutron-flux monitor used in the proton-trap measurement of the neutron lifetime. The proton-trap apparatus was used the most recent beam-lifetime measurement with the result for the lifetime of (886.3 +/- 1.2 (stat) +/- 3.2(sys)) seconds, where the systematic error is dominated by uncertainties related to the neutron-flux monitor calibration. The flux-monitor calibration campaign includes two independent calibrations using a monochromatic neutron beam at NIST and thick targets of Boron-10 or liquid Helium-3. For the Boron-10 approach, alpha particles and gamma rays are counted, and a set of measurements has recently been completed that demonstrated internal consistency and precision that would reduce the systematic error to about 0.5 sec. For the Helium-3 approach, the heat generated by the charged particles in the 3He(n,p)3H reaction is measured calorimetrically and converted to a neutron flux. The calorimeter approach, originally developed by our group, has been shown to be capable of measuring the flux to 0.1 % with 10 hours of integration. A number of improvements specifically related to the challenges of the liquid Helium-3 target have been completed at the University of Michigan, and the device will be moved to NIST with the aim of completing the calibration campaign by 2013 and undertaking the new proton-trap lifetime measurement on the new NIST NGC beam line in 2014.<br/><br/>The Nab spectrometer and experiment is to measure the beta-neutrino correlation at SNS. The magnetic-field-expansion spectrometer is designed to measure proton-electron coincidences using proton time-of-flight spectroscopy to extract the a parameter. It may also be possible to extract the Fierz interference b from electron spectroscopy in silicon detectors. The envisioned continuing physics program with the Nab spectrometer and polarized neutrons (abBA/PANDA) is extremely rich with the ability to over constrain V-A parameters for neutron decay and thus probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The University of Michigan group is responsible for all aspects of neutron polarization and polarimetry beginning, for Nab, by measuring the neutron polarization of the unpolarized FP-13 beam with sensitivity to the polarization of less than 0.01%.<br/><br/>The neutron is a sub-atomic particle that comprises more than half of the matter in the world. Within the nuclei of most atoms, the neutron remains stable, but when freed from the nucleus, it is unstable. Free neutrons are an important tool for study of sub-atomic physics, because the decay and interactions of free neutrons reveal the interactions of its constituents and decay products. Neutrons also have spin, the quantum mechanical property of the most fundamental pieces of matter that distinguishes two states called spin-up and spin-down. Spin is responsible for the nuclear magnetism exploited, for example, in NMR and MRI. The spin states also affect the decay and interactions of neutrons, and so the control of neutron spin becomes useful for more detailed study of sub-atomic interactions. This project envisions a program to incisively and carefully advance both the precision and the accuracy of the neutron lifetime and the correlation of electron and neutrino momenta in neutron decay. <br/><br/>The neutron lifetime is a measured fundamental quantity that impacts physics from the formation of the elements to the solar energy cycle to the structure of the Standard-Model of the weak interaction. Discrepancies among recent measurements have actually led to reduced confidence in the value of the neutron lifetime, and a new measurement using different techniques is essential to resolving the discrepancies. The measurement of the neutron lifetime using a cold neutron beam will provide a different approach, and accurate measurement of the neutron flux is crucial to the experiment. The neutron flux will be measured with a detector that has sensitivity that scales in the same way as the detection of neutron decays, but which must be calibrated by an absolute method. Absolute calibration will be achieved by measuring the heat produced when the neutrons are absorbed by Helium-3 in a cryogenic target at two degrees above absolute zero. The goal of this calibration is to provide an accurate neutron-flux measurement and determine the neutron lifetime with one-second precision.<br/><br/>The angle between the electron and neutrino produced in neutron decay is sensitive to the fundamental strength of the weak interaction when combined with the neutron lifetime. A broader class of measurements using polarized neutron can be used to probe beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. A new spectrometer designed to measure both the proton and electron energies in neutron decay will first measure the electron-neutrino correlation and then be used with polarized neutrons.<br/><br/>This work probes deep intellectual questions about the most fundamental pieces of matter. The aim is to collect data that will help complete the picture of elementary particles and their interactions. The techniques have much broader impact. Laser polarized Helium-3 used to polarize neutrons has applications to materials science, and quantum information research. This project is a remarkable training ground for undergraduate and graduate students and post doctoral fellows. The technical challenges combined with the deep intellectual issues provide motivation and develop technical skills. Undergraduates will gain research experience working along with graduate and post doctoral fellows. Graduate students emerge broadly capable and move on to prepare for faculty or national lab positions as well as interdisciplinary research. This work has also led to development of new courses for non-physics majors, to a set of public lectures on Nuclear Magnets and Neutrinos and leadership in communicating science to the interested general population. In the context of probing fundamental problems of physics, exciting in its own right, the hardest problems produce the most innovative solutions with spin-offs unimaginable at the outset. Atomic clocks, enhanced MRI, and experiments that probe the origin of matter all follow from the control of nuclear magnetism and neutron spins.|2

The results will reveal weak interactions and possible new physics beyond the Standard Model that summarizes known elementary particle interactions. The neutron spins in a beam of neutrons will be manipulated by selecting predominantly one spin state with a spin filter based on laser polarized 3He. The neutron spin can be reversed using magnetic fields that couple to the nuclear magnetic moment. Very precise measurement of the neutron polarization (i.e. the excess fraction of the selected spin state) and precise spin reversal are required to mitigate false effects that may arise in these experiments. Several of the techniques used in these experiments will be greatly improved over those of previous experiments.<br/><br/>Three major experiments will be undertaken. The objective of the first is measurement of the weak interaction effects on the absorption of neutrons by hydrogen. The weak interaction is characterized by absorption and emission of particles that have a handedness that correlates the spin orientation with the direction of motion. This handedness allows observation of the weak interaction amidst the much stronger interactions of neutrons and protons. Definitive characterization of the weak interaction between the neutron and proton is crucial to fully understanding the forces that bind the nucleus. This experiment will take data at Los Alamos before moving to Oak Ridge in 2007. An experiment at NIST aims to report the discovery of a rare mode of neutron decay, radiative decay, in which a photon is produced along with the neutrino, electron, and proton emitted in most neutron decays. The third experiment will be designed and apparatus built to detect the dependence of the direction of proton emission with respect to the decaying neutron spin. This proton direction dependence depends on the relationship of the multiple quantum paths from the initial neutron to the final decay products. It is affected by the intrinsic interactions among the fundamental particles that make up the neutron and proton and the emitted electron and neutrino. Advanced techniques of spin state selection, precision polarimetry, and spin flipping will be applied with the objective of precisely measuring the handedness of neutron decays. When combined with other neutron decay measurements these measurements will also probe physics beyond the Standard Model.<br/><br/>This work probes deep intellectual questions about fundamental issues in science.

The observation of neutrinoless DBD would not only establish the Majorana nature of the neutrino but also represent a measurement of its effective mass. So far, the most sensitive results have been obtained with Ge-76, and a group has claimed for the first time positive indications for neutrinoless DBD in Ge-76. The new GERDA experiment [1] will operate in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory an array of bare enriched Ge-76 diodes in a shield of liquid nitrogen or argon. This shield together with an additional water layer will reduce the external backgrounds by more than two orders of magnitude as compared to previous DBD experiments.

GRB are stellar remnants thought to be powered by black holes with masses several times the mass of the sun, which, in a few seconds, emit as much energy as our entire Milky Way does in a hundred years. However, it is not understood what kinds of stars give rise to these events, nor what is the exact mechanism whereby they produce gamma-rays, neutrinos and charged cosmic rays, nor how frequently or how far back in time they occur. AGNs, on the other hand, are suspected of harboring giant black holes, more massive than millions of suns, and are known to accelerate jets of electrons, which produce radio waves, light and ultra-high energy gamma rays. However, it is unclear if these jets also contain protons and neutrons, like some giant neutron gun, which would also entail highly penetrating neutrinos. Both ultra-high energy protons and neutrinos are targets for giant cosmic ray and neutrino telescopes being built by NSF in Argentina and in the South Pole, which will probe energies millions of times higher than any ever achieved in Earth laboratories. This is uncharted territory, and we need to know the theoretical ranges of possible results. A comparison of theoretical models with these experiments is imperative, in order to test the validity of current ideas (or the need for new ones) about how our Universe functions.

On the other hand, their interactions with cosmic microwave radiation should render the universe almost opaque to the most energetic of these particles, so that understanding how they can reach us from cosmic distances is a profound puzzle. Although they have been the subject of intense pursuit by science teams for several decades, our understanding of these highest energy cosmic rays remains hampered by their exceptional rarity. We are trying to study particles that arrive only once a century per square kilometer. Our method is to collect them with a detector array, called the Pierre Auger Observatory that, when completed, will span 3000 square kilometers in Argentina. <br/><br/>The Auger Observatory's cumulative data set at the highest energies, obtained during the construction phase of the project, already exceeds that of any previous cosmic ray experiment. This data set will expand by more than an order of magnitude over the next three years. One major advantage of Auger is that it utilizes simultaneously for the first time both techniques traditionally used by previous experiments to determine the energy of the primary cosmic ray. First, an array of detectors on the ground samples and detects the cascade of particles, or ""air shower,"" produced in the atmosphere by the interactions of the primary cosmic ray. On dark nights, special telescopes also image the pattern of nitrogen fluorescence, or sky glow, generated by the passage of the particle cascade through the atmosphere. These detection methods have complementary advantages and limitations, so that by combining them we will be in a position to minimize the systematic uncertainties inherent in either technique alone. In this manner, we have the best possible measurements of these rarest of particles. We will determine if there are protons, heavy atomic nuclei, photons, neutrinos, or possibly more exotic objects. The Auger group at Penn State University has experimental and analytical expertise in both detection techniques. We will conduct a variety of studies, both experimental and analytical, which will address some of the primary questions that must be resolved in minimizing the uncertainties in the combination of the two techniques. For instance, it is crucial to reduce the systematic uncertainty in fluorescence energy assignments, which result partly from uncertainty in the air fluorescence yield and partly from uncertainty in detector calibration. It is also essential to minimize uncertainty in atmospheric modeling. We will conduct a five-prong program of experimental work aimed at reducing fluorescence detection energy uncertainties. We will also continue to be heavily involved in the Auger spectrum analysis and in resolving the apparent discrepancy between the energy reconstruction of the two techniques. We will concentrate particular effort on areas of analysis in which we have special strengths and interests: anisotropy studies and the search for neutrinos near 10^18 eV or above. <br/><br/>High energy cosmic ray observations are an important domain of astrophysics that will produce new insights about extreme processes in the universe. Exciting news in cosmology and high energy astrophysics will be the theme of a week-long summer workshop that we are developing for high school teachers in Pennsylvania, to be offered in each of 3 consecutive years. The concepts of basic college physics are interwoven into the curriculum, so teachers strengthen their working knowledge of their core curriculum while getting an inside look at what is happening at the forefront of astrophysics research. We will take advantage of existing infrastructure and experience at Penn State from similar workshops in astronomy, chemistry and material sciences, and we will work with our colleagues in particle physics and particle astrophysics who have expressed a common interest in this endeavor."|2

In this scenario the reheating of the Universe, baryon asymmetry of the Universe, anisotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background and lepton flavour violation can all be simultaneously related tonight neutrino masses and mixings. This framework is predictive due to fewer free parameters than in the case of general thermal leptogenesis. We solve a relevant set of coupled Boatman equations for reheating and for leptogenesis, parametrizing neutrino Yukawa couplings through the light and heavy neutrino masses. For the parameters giving successful leptogenesis we compute threats of lepton flavour violating moon and taut decays. Those results are handled to the physics analyses group of the CMS experiment at LHC, which will search for LFV taut decays in their experiment. Undertaking the project at Community level will increase European research excellence and competitiveness (including the Estonian one) via scientific results of the project and via contributing to forming the physics program for the top European experiments. Both those criteria meet the objectives of strengthening the European Research Area. For the applicant personally this project will allow to carry out cutting-edge science, which secures his scientific independence and excellence, and, via re-integration, opens up a possibility for his long-term employment by the host institution.|2

It will concentrate on the physics responsible for the masses of many of these particles. This is the principal unsolved mystery in the standard model of the basic forces. The research will also deepen our understanding of quantum field theory, which provides the most useful mathematical language for the study of this physics. This language is important in other fields (condensed matter physics, for example) as well as in particle physics. This project also will focus on aspects of string theory. Specific areas of inquiry in string theory will include quantum gravity, aspects of strings propagating in a space (in particular, the study of strings in the context of cosmology and black holes), and topological field theories. String theory has been perhaps the most active area of research in high energy physics in the past seven years. Research in string theory is very important since string theory is the only known fundamental theory which reconciles quantum theory with Einstein's theory of gravity. This project will play an important role in the advancement of this subject by studying, classifying and unifying various solutions to string theory. Finally, the project will investigate the relations of elementary particles to objects and processes that cannot be directly studied at accelerators, such as the dark matter in the universe, black holes produced by gravitational collapse, grand unified theories and baryon number production in the early history of the universe.|2

The first set of his goals exploits the Pierre Auger observatory as an ultra-high-energy particle (UHE) physics laboratory. The PI intends to study the development of UHE cosmic ray (CR) cascades in the atmosphere. To distinguish between the effects of the cosmic ray composition and new effects related to novel hadronic physics, the proposed study will investigate the development of the CR cascades in the atmosphere. Another research area is for the PI to determine the flux of cosmogenic UHE neutrinos due to photomeson production (GZK effect). Once the total amount of data on UHE interactions coming from the Auger Observatory increases, the PI hopes to constrain the number of extra dimensions and probe the possibility of TeV-scale gravity (suggested by having extra spatial dimensions) by studying limits on the production rate of black holes in UHE particle interactions. Observations of the showers triggered by UHE neutrinos will be used to study neutrino interactions and mixing. By studying the development of UHE CR cascades in the atmosphere the PI hopes to identify exotic R-hadrons (standard hadronic states coupled with gluinos), if they exist and are metastable. The detection techniques of HE and VHE gamma rays have recently improved significantly allowing for much better angular resolution and sensitivity of the instruments. A cutting-edge instrument in MeV-sub TeV range GLAST, is scheduled for launch in 2008. The PI hopes to utilize the GLAST capability to shed light on the origin of gamma-ray emission. The PI also intends to study exotic particle physics at the LHC and Ice Cube: probes of quantum gravity, search for R-hadrons. He also intends to study of the ""unparticle"" parameter space which is the regime where conformal field theories at short distances can affect the physics seen at the LHC. The PI writes for several popular magazines and has appeared on BBC radio to publicize the physics potential of the Ice Cube neutrino telecope at the South Pole.

Recent solar neutrino experiments have indeed necessitated modifications of the SM. Further important observational in put can be expected in the future that might completely change our present-day understanding. Such opportunities resulted in renewed efforts of precision determinations of the electric dipole moment of the neutron d. In the SM d vanishes but in some supers ymmetric (SUSY) and Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scenarios this is not the case. Hence it is important to obtain more stringent experimental contraints. To realise the full potential of such experiments the dependence of d on the so-called theta angle that violates time reversal symmetry is required. The smallness of the theta angle is referred to as the ""strong CP"" problem. Using quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions between the quarks and gluons that make up the neutron, this rel ationship can be evaluated. This project aims at calculating the ratio d/theta. This is done by means of numerical simulations (Lattice QCD). A new 5 TFlops supercomputer in the UK will be used that has been developed by the researcher within a team of pa rticle theorists based at Columbia University.

Until recently, experiments have been done at US facilities such as Fermilab, SLAC, and Cornell CESR. These large labs often had in-house theoretical physics groups that could aid in the planning and analysis of the experiments. However next year, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will start operation, making obsolete all current US Collider laboratories. At this facility two large experiments, ATLAS and CMS will be supported approximately 30% by DOE and NSF and will have large participation by people previously working at the US facilities such as Fermilab, SLAC, and CESR. <br/>In order for the discovery capabilities of the LHC to be fully utilized many calculations and calculational tools need to be developed so that the theoretical uncertainties related to the standard model of strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions become less than the experimental uncertainties. Event generators used by experimentalists in analyzing data need to be generalized or totally rewritten so that signatures coming from candidate theories for explaining Beyond the Standard Model Physics can be understood and to compared with data. Finally, Non-standard Model ideas that include Supersymmetry, Extra Dimensions, Grand Unified Theories, Brane-world Scenarios, and String inspired Effective theories will need to be systematized and analyzed so that their predictions can be easily compared with the new data from the LHC including experimental cuts, backgrounds etc. The LHC is an essential discovery tool for finding new phenomena which go beyond the Standard Model and which already have been hinted at by the discovery of dark matter, dark energy and small masses for the neutrinos. The US effort in those areas of physics crucial to interpreting and making best use of the LHC facility needs revitalization. The US effort will have to be University based and is an excellent arena for training students and the next generation of Phenomenoligists. The purpose of the LHC initiative is to have a mentoring process for involving US graduate students and Post-Docs to get involved with calculations relevant for the interpretation and analysis of upcoming experiments. <br/>The initiative calls for one-year fellowships for graduate students and two-year fellowships for Post-docs to work under the guidance of a mentor on LHC related theory projects. The students, Post-Docs and Mentors will form a network with communication by teleconferencing. There will be two annual meetings with experimentalists to discuss the ongoing data collection process and its interpretation. It is hoped that the synergy between the young theorists and the experimental community will present a new paradigm for optimal discovery potential in the field of High Energy Physics. It is also hoped that this initiative will allow the US to again take a leadership role in High Energy Phenomenology. The network formed will provide a backbone for a nationwide collaborative theory network making it possible for physicists from isolated groups and smaller institutions to participate and focus their efforts on projects that are directly relevant to the LHC.|2

To achieve the required low background conditions, the detector must be located underground and be made of materials of natural radiopurity. It consists of a large ultra pure liquid scintillator operation in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy. The required purity levels are unprecedented and much of the effort of this proposal will be to develop special detector materials by powerful purification methods. This detector will be the first of its kind and will be the lowest background detector in the world. The scintillator detector proposed here, which has become known as the Borexino experiment, is designed to detect the 7Be neutrino in live mode. The expected count rate in the 100 ton fiducial volume is about 50 per day. The essential requirement of this experiment is a large unsegmented detector with uranium and thorium radiopurities of better than 0.5fg/g. A prototype detector with mass of a 4tons is currently under construction to test the purity of the scintillator an other technic aspects of the design, the initial research effort is to complete the development of the scintillator vessel and the scintillator purification system an to install these in the prototype detector. The second major effort will be to employ the test facility to study the effectiveness of purification processes. The researcher will then design the full scale Borexino experiment. ***|2

The solution to this mystery may lie in the existence of some new generic class of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, whose existence is also motivated by physics beyond the standard model of particle interactions. WIMP detection experiments require operation deep underground to prevent cosmic ray interactions from causing false positive signals. <br/> The LUX and ZEPLIN collaborations, building on their pioneering efforts in liquid xenon (LXe) dark matter detectors and their broad expertise in low background techniques and rare event searches, propose here a plan for the design of a 20-ton LXe detector (LZ20). The LZ20 detector will use established two-phase LXe technology with readout of primary and secondary scintillation signals for particle identification together with 3d position reconstruction to exploit the self-shielding of the LXe, removal of surface artifacts and calibration of position dependent response functions. This detector, installed at the 4850 level, with a fiducial mass of 13.5 tons and an initial operating period of 1000 days, will suppress internal and external backgrounds from electromagnetic and neutron interactions to below a single event and achieve a sensitivity to WIMP-interactions down to cross section of 10 to the power negative 48 cm2. At this exposure, the sensitivity will begin to encounter irreducible backgrounds from solar and atmospheric neutrino interactions this experiment therefore represents the definitive WIMP search that can be performed with liquid Xe.<br/><br/>Regarding Broader Impacts Dark Matter science is broadly appealing to the public, building on the natural curiosity of the public as well as the connection and familiarity with gravity. The collaboration proposes to develop a range of activities, from tours and displays to partnerships with local schools and individuals, to foster an interest in science and science careers. Dark matter experiments demand the development of new technologies that are ultra-sensitive to radiation, and new methods for achieving ultra-low radioactive backgrounds. There is an overlap of these technologies and methods with those used in a wide range of nuclear security contexts. Through direct technology development or through the training of personnel that transfer to industry or defense labs later in their careers, the collaboration expects significant impact from LZ20 particularly because of the involvement of LLNL. This proposal includes a description of postdoctoral mentoring plans.|2

That history is imbedded in salt deposits. Since cosmic ray muons interacting with salt deposits convert 23Na into 22Ne, the concentration of 22Ne in a given salt deposit is a measure of the integrated muon flux since the formation of that deposit. Salt deposits have well known ages based on fossils in adjacent strata and on their own internal clock, the ratio of 40Ar/40K: 40K decays into 40Ar with a half life of 1.28 billion years. <br/><br/>In addition to its intrinsic interest, the cosmic ray chronology of the Earth also will permit us to look for variation of cosmic ray intensity over time due to nearby supernova and see if there is a temporal relationship between these events and mass extinctions on Earth. <br/><br/>It is generally assumed that high energy proton cosmic ray primaries are generated in the outbound shock waves of supernovae. These shock waves accelerate protons for ~106 years. The protons then proceed in spirals with Larmor radii ~ 300 x E(eV)/B cm, where E is the energy of the proton, and B (in TGauss) is the interstellar Galactic magnetic field. Every ~107 years (t = 1/Nosc=107 yrs), these protons collide with interstellar matter. Since these collisions are primarily with other protons, the incident proton loses about half its energy per collision. After several collisions the energy of the initial proton is sufficiently reduced so that it is no longer a significant producer of high energy muons in the Earth's atmosphere. Thus, the effective duration of the high energy cosmic ray signal from a given supernova is 2 -3 x 107 years. <br/><br/>Nearby supernova, which occur every 108 years or so, will result in increased cosmic ray intensity for a period of 2-3 x 107 years. Since salt deposit ages range to 600 million years and beyond, they contain the records of several nearby supernova. Indeed, we may even be living in such a high cosmic ray flux period. Comparing the present cosmic ray flux with the average over the memory of various salt deposits will answer that question. <br/><br/>The extraction of neon and argon from salt solutions is identical to the extraction of argon from perchloroethylene, as in the Homestake chlorine solar neutrino detector, and the extraction of xenon from the sodium iodide detector we operated at LAMPF. <br/><br/>For a constant cosmic ray flux, the ratio of 22Ne/40Ar depends only on the depth of the deposit (and on the relevant cosmic ray muon cross sections and 40K concentration and life time). The depth history of each measured salt deposit will be determined by a combination of vitrinite reflection, illite crystalinity and fission track thermal-chronology together with the geological history of the region.|2

It is expected to play an important role in supporting the experimental effort and in discovering new physics. The computational demands for the high precision, phenomenologically interesting lattice QCD calculations are such that high performance massively parallel supercomputers are required. However, small scale resources are also critical for developing new ideas and training graduate and undergraduate students.

In the field of particle physics, there is increasing interest in using particle accelerators to form very intense beams of high-energy muons. Discovered in 1937, the muon, a more massive cousin of the electron, is a subatomic particle, whose simple and well-understood interactions with matter make it a useful probe for a range of purposes. Until now, however, due to its short average lifetime of 2.2 microseconds, it has not been possible to accelerate muons. The key step in demonstrating the feasibility of muon accelerators is the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE). The main obstacle to accelerating an intense muon beam is that such beams are created too large to fit into the typical vacuum chamber of a synchrotron and the short muon lifetime leaves little time to adequately shrink and accelerate the beam. Ionization cooling is a new technique to shrink, or cool a muon beam quickly. In this process, a beam of muons passes through selected material in which it loses energy by ionizing nearby atoms. These interactions reduce all three components of a muons velocity: horizontal, vertical, and longitudinal. The muon beam is then accelerated by radio-frequency cavities, replacing only the longitudinal velocity component of the muons. As the horizontal and vertical components are increasingly reduced while the longitudinal component is maintained, the muons trajectories become more nearly parallel, allowing focusing magnets to substantially reduce the size of the beam.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this proposal includes University of Mississippi students and local QuarkNet teachers who will be involved and will use acoustic sensors to locate and characterize sparking (electrical breakdown) in the RF cavity. Development of muon cooling could lead to building a neutrino factory and discovering CP violation in the lepton sector. Lepton CP violation may quite possibly cause the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry in the universe. A neutrino beam from a Neutrino Factory might be aimed at a detector in the National Science Foundation Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL).

The energy spectrum of GZK neutrinos provides important insight on the production mechanism and source distribution of the cosmic rays. In addition, a statistically significant measurement of the angular distribution of the diffuse cosmogenic neutrino signal can be used to infer the interaction cross-section at energies beyond those probed by Large Hadron Collider. While the physics of the GZK mechanism is straightforward (extragalactic UHE protons collide with cosmic microwave background photons, producing pions that eventually decay to neutrinos), answering how the cosmic rays were accelerated to very high energies is especially difficult because cosmic rays are bent by magnetic fields in our Galaxy, and their range is limited by the GZK mechanism to ~100 megaparcecs. There is now a long legacy of successful high-energy neutrino programs that utilize the abundant and transparent ice of Antarctica. In particular, ARIANNA relies on the detection of radio pulses generated after neutrino interactions in dense media by the Askaryan effect, capitalizing on several remarkable properties of the Ross Ice Shelf near McMurdo Station, the hub of U.S. Antarctic Program operations: (1) the ice is impressively transparent to electromagnetic radiation at radio frequencies, (2) the water-ice boundary below the shelf behaves like a good mirror to reflect radio signals from neutrinos in any downward direction, and (3) background noise levels were quite modest in the frequency band of interest. Its close proximity to McMurdo Station provides a number of suitable options for logistical support, and ARIANNA's scalable architecture allows it to follow the science. This award allows the project to develop the data acquisition electronics required by the ARIANNA autonomous stations.

The immediate goal is to investigate the operation of a 201 MHz radio frequency (RF) cavity in a high magnetic field at Fermilab in the MuCool Test Area. RF power and liquid helium are available there now and a 400 MeV proton beam is coming. The intent is to learn how to run a large RF cavity in a magnetic field while avoiding electrical breakdown. A cavity of this frequency is big enough to accept a large fraction of the muons coming from a primary proton target via pion decay. The RF cavities must be able to operate in magnetic fields, which is key both for neutrino factories and muon colliders. The group will also simulate muon cooling with an inverse cyclotron and to commission two high density aerogel (n=1.07 and 1.12) Cherenkov pi/ì discrimination detectors for the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) at the Rutherford Lab in the United Kingdom.<br/><br/> The broader impacts of this award are as follows.

However, their sources, nuclear composition and acceleration mechanism(s) remain unknown. Some possible sources include active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursters, and/or supernova remnants. In contrast to charged cosmic rays which bend in interstellar magnetic fields, the neutrinos that are expected to be produced in these accelerators travel in straight lines, so do point back to their sources. The IceCube observatory being built at the South Pole to search for these sources will soon reach 1 cubic km in volume. The accompanying 1 square km surface array (IceTop) detects air showers with energies above 300 TeV. Combining shower data with measurements of TeV muons from IceCube makes it possible to study the cosmic-ray composition. By using IceCube to veto events containing muons, it is also possible to identify photon-initiated showers. <br/><br/>This award will provide funds to study three topics pertaining to the origins and composition of cosmic rays: a search for a diffuse neutrino flux from the entire sky, a measurement of the transverse momentum (pT) spectrum of high pT muons in air showers, and a search for PeV photons from the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. During the three years of this grant, they will either observe extra-terrestrial neutrinos or set limits below the Waxman-Bahcall bound. The pT spectrum of these muons can be calculated using perturbative QCD, thus avoiding the phenomenological models that are required in other composition studies. The group will continue contributing to IceCube Maintenance and Operations work in the areas of optical module simulation and calibration, detector verification and calibration and in Monte Carlo simulation production. <br/><br/>The Education and Outreach component will communicate this forefront research to students and the general public, through presentations at elementary through high schools and public lectures.

Geoneutrinos are electron antineutrinos that come from the decay of Th and U from inside the Earth. This meeting is designed to initiate and foster an understanding of the shared science interests of these<br/>communities. The meeting will last three days (21-23 March) and discuss the latest results from the experiments in KamLAND, Japan and Borexino, Italy, as well as review future experiments in the field. The KamLAND and Borexino physics teams have stated that they are prepared to produce a publication of their latest results (comparable to the Phys Rev B 2010 and Nature Geoscience 2011 papers).<br/><br/>A subcommittee will select the US geo-scientists to bring to the meeting. Selection criteria are based on scientific breath and diversity including the fields of Seismology, Geodynamics, Mineral Physics, Geochemistry, Petrology and Geomagnetism. Preference will be given to new, first-time participants; and the committee specifically seeks to have at least on grad student or post-doc, as well as pre-tenured faculty and or lab scientists, and senior scientists. It is expected to support at this meeting a wide range of geoscientists including senior, mid-career and early career scientists and PhD students. Nearly all geoscientists have no available funding for attending such a meeting, and the field is newly emergent in geosciences.|2

Its primary goal is to discover cosmic neutrinos from Active Galactic Nuclei, Gamma Ray Bursts, or other astrophysical sources. The IceCube design makes it possible to discover extra-terrestrial point sources of muon-neutrino flux as well as a diffuse flux of electron, muon, and tau neutrinos that may originate from multiple sources.<br/><br/>This award will provide support for this group to analyze data obtained with the recently completed ICNO. They plan to measure the spectrum of yet unobserved high energy (~ TeV neutrino energies) atmospheric neutrino-induced cascades and to make sensitive searches for the diffuse flux of neutrino-induced muons. The combination of these search channels is anticipated to enhance the discovery potential of all-flavor diffuse neutrino flux searches. Once a signal is observed, the information about the neutrino flavor composition at Earth can be used to study the initial flavor composition of these fluxes at their source. The group will also study directional cascade reconstruction to search for up- and down-going neutrino-induced high energy cascades.

The observatory consists of a three dimensional array of photosensors buried deep in the Antarctic ice cap, with 59 of the planned 86 strings of sensors now deployed and operational. We are using data collected by IceCube to search for ultrahigh energy tau neutrinos. Tau neutrinos are produced when electron and muon neutrinos from astrophysical sources oscillate as they travel to us, but unlike electron and muon neutrinos, tau neutrinos are not produced in significant numbers in cosmic ray air showers in the Earth's atmosphere. Tau neutrinos are thus essentially guaranteed to come from astrophysical sources, and observing even a few tau neutrinos would tell us a great deal about astrophysical accelerators of cosmic rays and neutrinos. We have led the design effort for the new DeepCore extension to IceCube, which will be completely deployed at the South Pole in early 2010. Using IceCube and DeepCore, we will observe neutrino oscillations at higher energies than ever before, measure the spectrum of atmospheric electron neutrinos, search for sources of neutrinos in the Galactic plane, and search for dark matter in the Sun's gravitational well. <br/><br/>Students and postdoctoral scholars working on this project receive strong scientific and educational preparation in the techniques of particle astrophysics, high energy physics, and the mining of large data sets.

This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. <br/><br/>One of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. <br/><br/>But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Such measurements lie at the heart of this project.<br/><br/>There is currently a large interest in experimental particle physics in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) spurred in part by the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) project at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and in neutrino physics in general. This award supports work which refines LArTPC technology, using a test beam and at the MicroBooNE experiment at FNAL.<br/><br/>LArTPC detector technology is scalable to the very large masses (perhaps 10 kiloTons) needed by next generation neutrino experiments and is capable of recording three-dimensional digital images of particle trajectories. The MicroBooNE will have an active volume of 80 tons of liquid argon and 8256 wires spread over three instrumented wireplanes making up the Time Projection Chamber. MicroBooNE will make a variety of interesting physics measurements, as well as serving as a proving ground for new hardware techniques relevant for future experiments. Among MicroBooNE's primary physics goals is to provide a cross-check of the ""low-energy excess"" of electron neutrino events previously identified by the MiniBooNE experiment. There have been recent ""hints"" that there may be a new type of neutrino, the so-called sterile neutrino. The MicroBoone experiment, with the superior LArTPC, should clarify the situation: either rule out or confirm the sterile neutrino evidence. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this work will involve graduate students and undergraduates supported by this proposal receiving first-hand experience with High Energy Physics detector development, while also having access to MicroBooNE data that the graduate students will use for their dissertation analyses. The Syracuse group will continue with several outreach efforts as part of this proposal. The group maintains an outreach webpage that includes an ""Ask-a-A-Physicist"" questionnaire form as well as an active QuarkNet program."|2

Finally, the design performs ideally within the context of next-generation double beta decay searches using enriched Ge diodes (MAJORANA, GERDA), by accomplishing an efficient background rejection within a single-channel device, avoiding the complications and risks involved in using multi-channel segmented detectors.<br/><br/>Support is requested for a multi-year R&D program to further characterize the fabrication technique of this novel type of radiation detector, by building an additional six diodes, the intent being to develop the best possible design option for MAJORANA. Modest support is requested for immediate prototype deployment at the Columbia Generating Station, a 3.5 GWt boiling water reactor in Richland (WA), aiming at a first measurement of the coherent neutrino nuclear scattering cross-section and an improved (anti) neutrino magnetic moment sensitivity. <br/><br/>This research will continue to provide multiple opportunities for undergraduate involvement. The prospects and plans for a realistic deployment of small arrays of modified electrode detectors as reactor monitoring devices (non-proliferation safeguards) are also being developed.|2

This award, while nominally categorized under nuclear theory because of its focus on the structure and dynamics of subnuclear particles, also contains strong elements of particle theory, atomic physics, and even string theory. In order to reflect not only the wide interests of the PI and co-PI, but also to provide their Ph.D. students a wide range of exciting research opportunities, the project covers five distinct areas of study in which rapid progress is attainable. The award also provides some support for short-term visitors (collaborators and seminar speakers), whose expertise will stimulate further advances in the project areas, and travel funds for all personnel to present their findings at seminars and conferences and to learn about new advances in physics. The broader significance of this project is thus incorporated in (i) interdisciplinary research that crosses boundaries between fields, (ii) the training of junior researchers in the methods and findings these disciplines, and (iii) cross-institutional exchanges to maximize the effectiveness of all involved researchers' skills.<br/><br/>The five topics are:<br/><br/>(1) Baryons, such as protons and neutrons, can be studied by allowing the number of charges (Nc) of the strong nuclear force to vary. The ""1/Nc expansion"" is based on the idea that the structure and dynamics of baryons are easier to understand if Nc is considered a large number (it is 3 in our universe). But recent work shows that the expansion is not unique. The PI will compare the predictions of different 1/Nc expansions using experimental data to determine which, if any, is preferred.<br/><br/>(2) Generalized parton distributions are the most fundamental observable quantities for describing the structure of strongly-interacting particles such as protons. The upgrade at Jefferson Lab in Newport News, Virginia makes it possible to measure them with unprecedented accuracy, so the calculation of corrections to the older ""low-order"" results by the co-PI will be essential to our determination of whether one really understand what is going on inside a proton.<br/><br/>(3) Protons are sensitive not only to the strong nuclear force, but the weak force as well through the process of ""electroweak deep inelastic scattering"" (EW DIS), and these effects will appear not only in data at Jefferson Lab, but also subsequent facilities. The co-PI will calculate corrections to the lowest-order results, which will allow one to understand how multiparticle states are correlated at long distance and to separate known from as-yet-unknown physics.<br/><br/>(4) Both the PI and co-PI will study the origin of how different species of neutrinos, extremely light and electrically neutral particles, can transform into each other. They will employ both conventional symmetry approaches within the context of quantum field theory and string-theoretical approaches based upon the idea that particles arise from structures called ""D-branes"" that live in extra dimensions of spacetime but intersect with our dimensions.<br/><br/>(5) The PI will build on his recent work describing how to create ""true muonium"" - an atom consisting of a muon (a subatomic particle created, for example, in cosmic rays) and its antiparticle, in immediately realizable experiments. Like all atoms, it appears in a multitude of excited states with a rich spectroscopy, and how to create and characterize these states is interesting not only for its own sake but for precision tests of the electromagnetic forces that bind the true muonium atom."|2

The ELA is motivated by string theory, the sterile neutrino by problems with Lambda Cold Dark Matter theory and by the non-zero neutrino mass. The Fellow will test these new DM candidates with observables, connect these ideas to the established CMB anisotropy experimental program and the spectral distortion frontier, and better connect atomic physics to the thermalization epoch.

Neutrinos are the most prolific particles in the universe, and only since 1998 has it been established that they have any mass at all. It has now been well established experimentally, that in traversing from the sun to earth, and those created in our upper atmosphere, do change from one type to another, which requires that they do have mass. Determining their mass may also determine if they could account for part of the dark matter (sometimes called the missing mass of the universe). These experiments called neutrino oscillation experiments; however, cannot tell us how much mass they possess, just that their masses are not zero. There are two methods to directly determine the masses of neutrinos. <br/>In the first method, a precision measurement is made of the energy spectra of beta particles from radioactive decay of light nuclei. The deviation from the canonical theoretical shape of the energy spectrum near the high-energy end is a measure of the mass of the electron-type neutrino. These experiments are very difficult and are somewhat limited in mass sensitivity. Nevertheless, within their range of sensitivity, they are very valuable.<br/>In the case that neutrinos are their own anti-particles, there is an exotic radioactive decay called neutrinoless double-beta decay, that would be far more sensitive to neutrino mass. In addition, establishing by direct observation that this process exists, would prove that neutrinos are their own anti-particles. This in itself is extremely important for completing the theory of elementary particles. It would also support specific models of the very early universe that explain why the universe is almost completely particles at present, with almost no anti-particles. Without some small excess of particles over anti-particles in the very early universe, we ourselves, and all we see, could not exist today. <br/>The projects CUORE and Majorana are both large, next generation neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. They are being designed to probe a mass range a factor of ten more sensitive than presently exists from three experiments, two of which the PI of this grant participated in with leadership roles. The Majorana experiment is a proposed 500 kg array of high purity Ge detectors, isotopically enriched in 76Ge, the candidate parent double beta decay nucleus. It involves five national laboratories and eight universities. It would be built in the US with US technology. I involves many graduate students and will be a prolific source of PhD thesis material. There are a number of spin-off technologies useful in nuclear weapon non-proliferation and in homeland defense.<br/>CUORE is a proposed 750 kg array of cryogenic detectors of tellurium oxide to search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of the isotope 130Te. It is a collaboration between Italy and the US, and is being constructed in the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Assergi, Italy. It is a new technology because of its mass. It offers the same kind of educational opportunities as does Majorana, and is training US graduate students and post doctoral scientists in the technology of very large cryogenic detectors that do not exist in the US.|2

It has no electric charge but has an intrinsic angular-momentum(or spin) of one half unit of Planck's constant just like it's cousin the electron. Discovered in 1957 by Reines and Cowan, it remains one of the least understood particles in the elementary zoo. According to conventional wisdom, in modern cosmology the universe is densely populated with neutrinos. Accordingly,if they would have a large enough mass, they could have played an important role in the evolution of the universe in it's early stages and even at present. Approximately 90% of the mass of the universe has not been identified. In 1998 it was announced that<br/>neutrinos resulting from the decay of cosmic-ray muons in the atmosphere were found to oscillate between different families. This would require that they do have some mass but such experiments do not yield how much. The rate of the hypothesized rare radioactive decay called double-beta decay can yield this very valuable information when combined with the neutrino oscillation results. The interesting version of this phenomenon would result if a nucleus would decay by emitting two electrons and nothing else. An important conservation law would be violated by such a process unless two anti-neutrinos were also emitted with the electrons. Since the electrons are leptons and the anti-neutrinos are anti-leptons the total number of leptons is conserved in the the decay with anti-neutrinos. For the decay to occur without anti-neutrinos, neutrinos in general must have mass and an important symmetry in physics must be violated. The Majorana and CUORE experiments, which are the subjects of this proposal, are next generation no-neutrino double-beta decay experiments with an improvement in the sensitivity to neutrino mass that is predicted to be about one hundred times better than the best experiments done to date.<br/>Considering all the data available, they have a significant probability<br/>for discovery, for being able to provide important information on the<br/>mass of neutrinos as well as to determine if neutrinos are there own<br/>anti-particles. CUORICINO is a smaller first step towards building the<br/>full version of CUORE.|2

This work is centered around the NSL facilities, but also utilizes accelerators at other laboratories. The research program emphasizes extensive collaborations with experimental and theoretical physicists at other universities, often involving visits by these scientists and their students in order to use the NSL accelerator facilities.<br/>The active areas of research at the NSL include reaction studies with short-lived radioactive nuclear beams, nuclear astrophysics, the study of weak interactions and related fundamental processes, and nuclear structure physics. These four topics span a large fraction of the frontiers of nuclear-physics research, and have a particularly large overlap with other areas of many-body physics. Yet, they are all closely related. For example, radioactive-beam physics is an important issue both for modern nuclear-astrophysics research and for the study of nuclear properties far from the valley of stability, while the properties of the nucleus as a quantal many-body system can and have been exploited to learn more about the laws of physics at the most fundamental level. The NSL is the site of pioneering work in the development of low-energy radioactive nuclear beams, and is an important center for research in nuclear astrophysics. In addition, local research groups in Atomic Physics and Radiation Chemistry carry out interdisciplinary programs using the NSL facilities.<br/>Specific topics of current interest in nuclear astrophysics include the production of the elements in steady-state ""nuclear burning"" in main sequence stars, and in violent events such as nova and supernova explosions. The radioactive nuclear beam research is directed at achieving a better understanding of nuclear reaction processes relevant for solar neutrino physics, as well as the structure and reactions of weakly-bound ""halo"" nuclei which appear at the limits of nuclear stability and are believed to have very diffuse surfaces that are rich in either neutron or proton matter. The fundamental-interactions program emphasizes several issues relevant to the search for physics beyond the standard electroweak model of elementary particle physics, including the search for ""scalar currents"" in weak decays and the limits to time-reversal violation in the decay of the neutron. In addition, the weak decays of nuclei relevant for various aspects of solar neutrino physics are being explored. The nuclear structure program involves the study of static and dynamic nuclear phenomena, such as the harmonic and anharmonic vibrations of nuclei, the recently discovered ""magnetic"" and ""anti-magnetic"" rotation phenomena, and the attempt to obtain a more complete description of the structure of ""super-deformed"" nuclei."|2

The interrelated physics of neutrinos and strong interaction physics/nuclei is at the heart of current theories for the origin of the light nuclei and the baryon/lepton numbers in the early universe, the origin of the heavy nuclei in stellar collapse-based events, the dynamics of supernovae, and potentially even the dark matter/energy problems. Nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics stand at the contact point of two great current trends in science: (1) the ongoing experimentally driven revolution in neutrino physics; and (2) the startling recent advances in the capabilities of observational astronomy, especially in cosmology. This represents a tremendous opportunity for advancing both fundamental neutrino/nuclear physics and astrophysics and cosmology through their interconnection. The work supported by this project will aim at exploiting this opportunity. In fact, the PI and his graduate students over the last three funding cycles have discovered a number of these connections between fundamental weak interaction/neutrino/nuclear physics and the frontiers of astrophysics, in early universe physics, the physics of gravitational collapse, nucleosynthesis, and especially the possible connections between neutrino ?avor transformation and dynamics/nucleosynthesis. This has proven to be an excellent training ground for graduate students (7 PhD's in 9 years, all of whom have positions in nuclear physics research, and 5 have tenured or tenure track positions) and undergraduates (6 REU undergraduates). This project will enable the continuing training of excellent students. Coupled with the PI's seminars/outreach and publications, this constitutes the broader impact of this project beyond the scientific product. Arguably, the mass-squared differences and vacuum mixing angles (save for 13) of the neutrinos are now measured. A key goal of this project is to assess and calculate the impact of this new knowledge on models for the physics of the early universe, gravitational collapse, and nucleosynthesis. Some neutrino properties, like the CP-violating phase(es) and 13 remain unmeasured. A goal here will be to assess the role of these quantities in astrophysical environments with an eye toward constraints. Ultimately, the full extent of the neutrino mass and mixing spectrum, especially regarding right-handed states remains mysterious. Because the cosmological parameters (e.g., as derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotopies) and neutrino properties are so tightly constrained, a positive result in the on-going mini-BooNE experiment, for example, could signal the existence of a light SU(2) singlet 'sterile' neutrino which mixes with active species. This might also signal the existence of a large net lepton number(s) as well as call for a radical overhall of existing models for stellar collapse, heavy element nucleosynthesis, the role of neutrinos in dark matter/energy, and the origin of the baryon number. Observations of Ultra Metal Poor halo stars recently have given us new insight into the r-process which challenge existing models (e.g., the solar system abundance pattern seems to be universal for nuclear masses > 100). <br/>The PI and his students will direct analytic and numerical calculations toward: (1) an understanding of active-active and active-sterile channel neutrino flavor transformation in the early universe as regards big bang nucleosynthesis and lepton number generation/destruction/limits, CMB derived neutrino mass limits, supernova shock re-heating, r-process nucleosynthesis, the supernova neutrino signal, and all with emphasis on insight into the newly discovered fixed point solution for the nonlinear neutrino-neutrino forward scattering 'background' potential in the active-active neutrino/antimeutrino conversion channel; (2) a further study of neutrino-nucleus interactions in stellar collapse/heavy element nucleosynthesis, including de-excitation of hot nuclei into neutrino pairs and neutrino capture-induced fission, as well as a consistent treatment of the relationship between the high temperature nuclear partition function and the weak strength distribution in nuclei; (3) studies directed toward better constraints on sterile neutrino dark matter from better knowledge of the physics of the QCD epoch in the early universe, from future x-ray observatories, and from the effects of these particles in post-supernova explosion neutron stars, especially the way in which the neutrino potentials which the govern de-coherence production of these heavy states evolve with time; (4) exploring the role of dynamical neutrino mass generation in cosmology; (5) studies of high neutron excess r-process nucleosynthesis with fission cycling.|2

If indeed neutrinos are Majorana particles, a measurement of the NDBD half-life would yield the effective Majorana mass of the electron neutrino. Combined with neutrino oscillation data, it would determine all three neutrino mass eigenvalues. Leptogenesis in the early universe is only possible if there are Majorana neutrinos.

The IceCube detector has currently deployed 22 strings and by the start of this grant proposal period IceCube will have more than half the volume instrumented and be approaching one cubic kilometer-year of accumulated data. The observation of high-energy neutrinos from distant astrophysical sources will open a new window on the sky and will provide new information on the acceleration mechanisms at work in these objects and insight into the nature of cosmic radiation.<br/><br/>This proposal requests funds for the Maryland group to pursue the following physics goals with the IceCube detector for which they have had a major part in building: 1) search for astrophysical point sources of neutrinos using muons in IceCube, 2) search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles using muon neutrinos in IceCube, 3) search for neutrinos coincident with gamma-ray bursts, 4) search for exotic particles such as monopoles and 5) search for high energy diffuse neutrinos of astrophysical origin. <br/><br/>Milagro has demonstrated that a water-Cherenkov shower detector is a powerful tool for looking at the TeV sky. Their survey of the galaxy revealed both new TeV sources (at least one with a spectrum extending to ~100 TeV) and strong diffuse emission. While detector operations will end this year, this proposal will allow them to continue analysis on the Milagro data. <br/><br/>IceCube and Milagro are strongly connected with other experiments in the field of Particle Astrophysics as they are part of a multi-messenger survey of the high energy sky. These experiments have a strong appeal both to the physics students and the general public and this group has an established track record in both public outreach and providing strong scientific and educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.|2

When high energy cosmic rays interact with matter, magnetic fields and ambient photons they generate high energy gamma rays and/or neutrinos of high energy. Some of these neutral particles travel directly to the earth and, when observed by gamma ray telescopes, can both provide essential information about not only the origin and distribution of cosmic rays and their sources, but also can serve as probes for gamma rays expected from the annihilation of dark matter. Thus they allow the study fundamental high energy astrophysics as well as particle physics. As the flux of these high energy gamma rays is small, large acceptance detectors with good pointing and adequate cosmic ray rejection capabilities are essential for this study. <br/><br/>The Milagro detector uses a new technique to detect high energy gamma rays. It allows the simultaneous and continuous viewing of the entire overhead sky in the TeV energy domain. It detects the bundles of energetic particles produced by high energy gamma ray interacting in the atmosphere, which acts like an amplifier of each high energy photon. Detection occurs by sampling light photons produced by these relativistic particles in a 6 million gallon water tank instrumented with 737 photomultiplier tubes. The pulse height and arrival times of these photons permit reconstruction of the celestial direction of the original particle, as well as rejection of most of the unwanted cosmic ray showers. Its continuous operation allows observation of both steady and transient sources of TeV gamma rays. <br/><br/>Milagro has detected and measured the energy spectrum of gamma rays from the Crab neubla; from active galactic nuclei (AGNS) blazars Mrk 501 and 421 in their active phases; from a gamma ray burster (GRB); and of diffuse TeV gamma ray emission from the inner galactic disc region from interaction of cosmic rays with matter in the galactic disc, and from TeV gamma ray sources in the Cygnus arm of the galaxy. These observations provide new and important data for the understanding of the origin, acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays. Under this NSF grant, work will continue on refining the observations of these and other possible objects, and on analyzing the data.<br/><br/>The Milagro experiment and data have provided excellent training ground for undergraduate student research experience and for graduate student training in hardware and software. UCI also has several active programs, such as COSMOS and Quarknet , for outreach to K-12 teachers and students. We have been involved in communicating to school students at K-12 levels and to seniors (Academy of Continued Life Long learning).|2

Since data acquisition started in 2007, Borexino has reached its design goal and measured the flux of mono-energetic 7-Beryllium solar neutrinos with enough precision to test the predictions of current solar models. After a scintillator purification campaign in 2011, Borexino is in a new phase of solar neutrino physics with the goal of measuring the entire solar neutrino spectrum. A precise knowledge of solar neutrinos will allow us to understand how the sun and other stars work, test the MSW-LMA neutrino oscillation paradigm and search for deviations from it. Borexino will possibly resolve an open question on the metallicity of the Sun's core, an important piece of information with which to study the evolution of larger stars in the universe. <br/><br/>DarkSide-50, a dual-phase time projection chamber scheduled to come online in late 2012, will prototype design solutions for background free multi-tonne detectors with liquid argon as active target for WIMPs. A null observation would exclude some of the current leading dark matter candidates. A positive detection would begin to give answers to one of the big scientific unknowns of our times. DarkSide-50 will run with 50 kg of argon depleted more than 100-fold in the radioactive 39-Argon isotope. The DarkSide-50 Argon cryostat is surrounded by a compact, liquid scintillator neutron detector and immersed in the Borexino Counting Test Facility (CTF) water tank instrumented and operated as a Cherenkov muon veto. The Borexino and DarkSide collaborations have a significant overlap in personnel and technical and operational resources. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The Borexino and DarkSide projects provide excellent opportunities for the training of graduate and undergraduate students in applications of software and hardware development, and fundamental physics. The techniques developed for Borexino and Darkside-50 can more broadly benefit technology relevant for medical imaging, nuclear non-proliferation and geology.|2

The IceCube Observatory is currently being constructed at the Antarctic South Pole Station and data taking was scheduled to begin in early 2005 with the deployment of the first strings of IceCube photodetectors. The combination of these new strings and the existing AMANDA strings will make IceCube an extremely powerful detector and the analysis of the data should be started as soon as possible. <br/><br/>This funding will enable the Maryland group to take a major role in producing results from this exciting new detector. The field of neutrino astronomy is on the threshold of a new era with the construction of the 1 cubic km IceCube neutrino detector. The observation of high-energy neutrinos from distant astrophysical sources will open a new window on the sky, which will provide new information on the acceleration mechanisms at work in these objects and insight into the nature of cosmic radiation. During the period of this award, the IceCube detector will reach the milestone of 1 cubic km-year of telescope data. To become the world's most sensitive detector, there are important performance characteristics that must be characterized and understood. This group will investigate how to improve the detector while they are publishing results of searches with an unprecedented sensitivity for the potential detection of high-energy astrophysical neutrino sources. The specific physics topics they plan to address are: 1) a search for astrophysical point sources of neutrinos using muons in the IceCube detector; 2) a search for WIMP particles using muon neutrinos in the IceCube detector; and 3) the development of techniques and reconstruction methods for identifying shower cascades in the IceCube detector as a way to measure electron and tau type neutrinos.<br/><br/>For Broader Impacts both the Maryland group and IceCube have been very active in exposing students and the general public to the excitement of the particle astrophysics field. IceCube, in particular, brings a unique sense of adventure to the subject, and makes it easy to capture the attention of people from all walks of life. Maryland is also a mentor site for the Quarknet program.|2

A broad range of topics in particle physics such as supersymmetry, extra dimensions, neutrino physics and grand unification are covered. Topics in cosmology cover the nature and origin of dark matter and dark energy and their implications for large scale structure of the universe. The unifying theme is the search for new physics that explains various puzzles of the successful standard model of particle physics and cosmology and their tests at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and various ongoing non-accelerator searches for new physics such as dark matter, neutrino mixings, astrophysical anomalies and cosmic microwave background. These projects will extend the frontiers of our understanding of quark-lepton phenomena and the early Universe and may lead to discovery of new particles and forces. The research program will support graduate students and postdoctoral associates. The PIs will develop a strong program of research for high school and undergraduate students, with an emphasis on students from historically black colleges. The research work of this group will be disseminated through public and school lectures, participation in science fairs, and media broadcasts.

Work on the planning for a Linear Collider includes studies of semi-leptonic D decays at CESR-c/CLEO-c, and construction of the BTeV pixel cooling system. The Wayne State University outreach efforts are centered on a separately funded REU/RET program that trains students and high school teachers in the winter and takes them to the labs in the summers, e.g. STAR at Brookhaven, CESR, CLEO, and BTeV. Ten students and four teachers are trained each year with a high fraction being from underrepresented groups and first in family in higher education. The WSU program also produces direct research benefits as a few of the students have co-authored peer reviewed publications with the PI's.

The PI and his graduate dissertation student (partially funded by this grant) will investigate possible ""flavor"" symmetries among the three fermion generations, especially the constraints imposed upon them by recent and forthcoming experimental results on neutrino masses and mixing. Additional constraints to be taken into account arise from limits on flavor-changing neutral current processes and proton decay. These studies are designed to work toward answering the question of why there are three replicated generations of fermions with nonetheless widely differing masses and mixings.<br/><br/>2) Baryons in the Large N Limit. The PI will build upon the numerous successes of QCD with a large number N of color charges (large N) to study the dynamics of baryon resonances. These particles are now being produced in huge numbers at Jefferson Lab, but the theoretical tools currently used to study them are limited. In particular, the PI will seek model-independent results that respect not only the large N expansion, but also the chiral symmetry implied by coupling among pions and nucleons (to which the resonances decay).<br/><br/>3) Rigorous QCD Constraints on Hadronic Quantities. The imposition of constraints from dispersion relations allows one to make precise statements about QCD amplitudes even in the nonperturbative regime. One obtains relations between fundamental quantities such as quark and gluon parameters on one hand, and measured quantities such as form factors on the other. These relations can provide subtle and highly nontrivial information on the way that the strong interaction works, and form the motivation for this work. The PI will continue this successful program to consider such cases as expanding the range of applicability and including additional information from the region of asymptotic freedom."|2

These new observations strongly motivate further studies of the intrinsic properties of neutrinos, including tests of whether they are Majorana or Dirac-type particles. Natural conjectures suggest that a deeper understanding of neutrinos may provide a glimpse onto phenomena at a Planck-scale energy level, could broaden our knowledge of the fundamental forces, could shed light onto the initial creation of leptons and baryons, and can help to improve our understanding of the early evolution of the Universe. Majorana-type neutrinos lead to a neutrinoless double beta decay (NDBD) &#8722; the second-order weak nuclear process for which an initial state nucleus with atomic weight and number (A, Z) is transformed into a nucleus of (A, Z + 2), with the emission of only two electrons. In this transition, the lepton number changes by two units and the two electrons in the final state carry the energy equal to the energy of nuclear transition. This award will provide funds to purchase 200 8-inch diameter PMTs to complete the construction of the first SuperNEMO module, the Demonstrator. The next three years are critical so this contribution is timely and crucial to the success of this phase of the experiment.<br/><br/>Among the broader impacts of this project, unraveling the nature of neutrinos will have far-reaching implications for better understanding of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions. On the technical side, the group is developing a unique low background counting technique which may be applied outside of physics and can be of general benefit to society. They educate and train young researchers in building state-of-the-art science projects.

(2) Search for bursts of correlated muon, electron, and tau neutrinos in the northern hemisphere. The team will use the best possible efficiency of detecting flaring time profiles by correlating the time, energy, and spatial positions of multiplets of neutrino events from both muon and cascade channels that will effectively double the effective area of the detector compared to present usage.

A unique partnership of 17 countries has come together to pursue this science. The Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO), completed in June 2008, has accumulated data since January of 2004, and has already yielded results that are the first crucial steps toward those scientific goals. <br/><br/>The growing Auger data set will address vital questions in astrophysics and particle physics. The PAO will continue to map the southern sky to strengthen the correlation of the highest energy events with extragalactic sources. A continuously enriched sample of hybrid events with measured longitudinal development will improve our understanding of the cosmic ray composition and features of particle interactions from LHC energies to those well beyond. Resolving the puzzle of apparent excess of muons will benefit from increasing statistics. A precise spectrum measurement in the ankle region with the help of the AMIGA in-fill and the HEAT high elevation telescopes will help determine the transition from galactic to extragalactic sources. Based on hints in the data the search for galactic sources of neutrons and photons may well be fruitful. Finally a search for EeV neutrinos will continue to be of great interest.<br/><br/>This award will provide partial funding for the continuing operation of the PAO in Argentina. Collaborating countries fund the operations of the Observatory in proportion to the number of senior authors they have on Auger science publications. The US portion of these operating costs is being shared equally by the National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy.<br/><br/>The study of the highest energy cosmic rays, the most energetic particles in nature, will have broader impacts on the understanding of particle physics at the highest energies as well as astrophysics. The PAO has been a highly successful venue for the training of students and postdocs. The centerpiece of outreach to Malargüe, Argentina, and other nearby communities, the Auger Visitor Center attracts increasing numbers of visitors, typically 6000 each year with the total now exceeding 45,000 since 2001. The Auger collaboration has sponsored two science fairs and has given numerous lectures in the local communities and schools. The daily public release of about 1% of reconstructed events is being used for school projects in many locations."|2

Muons are easily produced at particle<br/>accelerators, and they are a major component of cosmic rays at the<br/>surface of the earth. According to all experimental evidence they are<br/>the same as electrons except that they are 200 times heavier, and they<br/>are radioactive. It is a great mystery why muons exist at all.<br/><br/>Like the electron, the muon can be thought of as a sphere which spins on<br/>its axis. It is also a magnet, with the north pole pointing along the<br/>spin axis. For a number of years, we have been doing an experiment to<br/>measure the strength of this magnet to very high precision. The value<br/>of this quantity is very sensitive to the spectrum of particles; if<br/>there are new, as yet unseen particles, then the value will be altered<br/>from theoretical expectations. We have seen a deviation from the<br/>expected value which is interesting but not yet big enough to be<br/>convincing evidence of new physics. We are proposing further<br/>measurements to sharpen the comparison between theory and experiment. <br/>At the same time, we are mounting major experiments to investigate other<br/>parameters of the muon: its lifetime, its electric dipole moment, and<br/>the probablility that it will decay directly into an electron without<br/>the usual accompanying neutrino. The last process has never been<br/>observed, and is expected to be very rare. The lifetime experiment is<br/>well under way, while the other two experiments are in development.|2

In the first project, several observables in neutron beta decay are studied; the combination of these observables with another experimental result (the determination of the neutron lifetime) determines the coupling constants of the weak interaction which causes the neutron decay. They are used as a sensitive test of the validity of the present theory which describes weak interaction coupling nucleons to leptons (the electrons and neutrinos produced in neutron decay). A related process is the weak coupling between nucleons and other nucleons, and the second project, a measurement of the asymmetry in the direction of gamma ray emission relative to the polarization of a neutron in the neutron capture on protons, is performed to determine the strength the dominant process of the weak interaction between nucleons. The third project is the characterization of gravitationally bound quantum states of ultracold neutron in the gravitational field over a glass mirror. A series of experiments is used to search for new short range interactions which would influence these quantum states. Finally, a purifier will be built for Helium-4 which is used as a production target for ultracold neutrons in a search for the electric dipole moment of the neutron. The Helium-3 contamination has to be reduced far below the natural abundance to avoid the reassertion of the ultracold neutrons on Helium-3 impurities.<br/><br/>The common goal of this experimental program is to test the Standard Model in regions which were not accessible before, or at least not as precise. A discovery of something not explained in the Standard Model would have important implications for High Energy Physics and Cosmology.

Ioana Niculescu, Dr. Kevin L. Giovanetti, Dr. Gabriel Niculescu, James Madison University<br/><br/>The James Madison University Particle and Nuclear Physics Group, consisting of three faculty and a group of undergraduate students, conducts research in Intermediate Energy Nuclear Physics at Jefferson Lab (JLab), at Fermi National Lab (Fermilab), and at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The aim of our group is to integrate important contributions to research with a quality educational experience for promising undergraduate students. <br/>The group members are actively involved in ongoing research in both Hall B and C at JLab (detector design and testing, data taking, data analysis). The group is also a key collaborator in the MULAN experiment (Muon Lifetime Experiment) underway at PSI and in the Minerva experiment (Neutrino-Nucleus Interactions) at Fermilab. <br/><br/>These experiments are designed to explore the rich structure of the nucleons (proton or neutron), which are the basic building blocks of the atomic nucleus. It is widely held that protons and neutrons are built out of three quarks, viewed as fundamental particles, held together by gluonic forces. A complete picture of multi-quark systems (protons, neutrons, etc.) is not yet available. Studies that probe the structure of nucleons and nuclei, such as those in which our group participates at JLab and Fermilab, hope to clarify this picture. <br/>Of the four fundamental forces, the weak force is the only one that can change one fundamental particle into another. Recent theoretical and technological advancements have created the opportunity to improve our knowledge of the strength the weak force, by measuring the lifetime of the muon (MULAN experiment) with unprecedented precision. This allows the extraction of the Fermi coupling constant, which determines the strength of the weak force in the same manner as electric charge determines the strength of the electromagnetic force.|2

By examining extensions of the Higgs sector, the group will find ways to test the minimal models of supersymmetry and to distinguish among various models using data. This will also tie into tests of lepton flavor violation through Higgs decays, a phenomenon deeply connected to the ongoing efforts to study neutrino masses and mixings. Finally, connections will be explored between the physics of the Higgs boson, supersymmetry and the astrophysical problems of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the universe. In so doing, the group seeks to increase our understanding of physics which is not readily measured in experiment, such as the source of the neutrino masses and the properties of the dark matter correlated with experimental signatures for SUSY at the LHC.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, this project includes continued outreach to the Notre Dame academic community through new and innovative courses in modern physics for non-science majors, work on improving academic advising throughout the university, and programs designed to increase the number of Notre Dame students pursuing graduate studies in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This is coupled to continued outreach to the greater Northern Indiana community through public lectures and planetarium shows on the Notre Dame campus, and interactions with local high schools through the QuarkNet program.|2

They also propose applying field theory concepts to important problem in Biology such as RNA folding as well as using modern methods to understand Quantum Chaos. The proposed research in string theory will focus on fundamental questions in the formulation of the theory (including high energy scattering, time-dependent configurations, and holographic duality), possible observational signatures via cosmic superstrings, and the application of gauge/string duality to physics of gauge theories and other field theories. Related investigations include issues of scattering in gravitational theories, lessons from the black hole information paradox, and applications of models of emergent gravity to black hole physics. In particle physics and astrophysics, problems to be studied include the study of supersymmetric models, research to understand the smallness of the up quark mass and a proposal on how to solve the strong CP problem of QCD. There is also proposed a variety of studies in neutrino physics including studying the predictions for lepton masses in tetrahedral group models, CP violation in the lepton sector, and relations between neutrino and charged lepton masses. Research in quantum chaos theory will focus on the Ruelle resonances and their role in classical and quantum dynamics. Work in quantitative biology will continue the study of the topology of RNA folding using random matrix theory and Monte Carlo methods. Research in lattice gauge theory will be directed at the study of the masses of strongly interacting particles, the properties of light pseudoscalar mesons, the decays of particles with heavy quarks, the behavior of strongly interacting matter at high temperatures, and the generation of gauge configurations with improved staggered quarks for use by other lattice gauge theorists in their own research.<br/>The scientific broader impact of this proposal is that research in string theory is aimed at developing a unified theory of all of the fundamental interactions of nature. The proposed research in particle phenomenology and lattice gauge theory is directly related to, and supportive of, programs in experimental high energy physics. Furthermore, part of the effort in lattice gauge theory is aimed at developing large-scale computational infrastructure for the entire U.S. lattice gauge theory community. The approach being taken has broad possibilities for application to computationally-intensive problems in many areas of science and engineering. The research topics covered by this proposal provide excellent educational opportunities for students and postdocs. This educational role is also greatly strengthened by interactions with the many visitors to the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP).|2

The sources of the highest energy charged cosmic rays have not been clearly identified. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and black holes distributed throughout the cosmos provide possible sources distributed through all epochs of expansion. Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) produce so-called cosmogenic neutrinos when they undergo inelastic collisions with the cosmic microwave background radiation. Over cosmic distances, neutrino mixing produces approximately equal populations of the three neutrino species when they get to the earth. Various astrophysical models for proton shock acceleration in the jets of AGN give a range of neutrino flux and energy distributions in the 0.1-1.0 EeV range. <br/><br/>Because the neutrino cross section rises with energy, neutrinos in this energy range are too energetic to penetrate the earth. This group proposes to construct a small prototype TAUWER array that will detect the decays of tau-leptons produced by tau-neutrinos moving upward along a chord in the earth's crust. The detector will sit on a steep mountain slope looking down along the chord near a zenith angle of 92 degrees. This proposal will initiate the TAUWER project, building 5 stations to study their performance in the field and to identify improvements and simplifications for the full system. Prototype detection elements have been tested and show clear discrimination capability between upward-coming and downward-moving particles. TAUWER is a modest cost, quickly deployable experiment that will provide new measurement capability and good overlap with other projects in this area. The successful completion of this one-year effort will establish the feasibility of installing and operating a complete TAUWER. <br/><br/>This proposal draws on the experience from a spring 2007 engineering course at CMU involving 10 undergraduate engineers and social science students. An expansion to include high school students and teachers is planned for the full project. Data from the full installation will be complementary to other neutrino astrophysics experiments.|2

TAUWER will implement it so as to provide an instrument of greater sensitivity, straight-forward expansion by an order of magnitude, and relatively low cost. TAUWER is a two-layer scintillator sampling telescope to detect the upward-moving air showers from tau hadronic decays. The hadronic decay channel of the tau-lepton makes possible a simple detection scheme based on identifying gammas, electrons and muons and determining their spatial density around the shower axis. Thus, detecting the showers from a set of tau-lepton decays gives a good estimate of the parent tau-neutrino spectrum. TAUWER is expandable, should future data indicate that need.<br/><br/>Previous work by this group has demonstrated that TAUWER detectors can separate upward and downward moving tracks by time of flight and to separate electrons and muons by waveform analysis after a Pb converter. This award provides funding to address the next crucial question in TAUWER validation - how well can one reject Extensive Air Shower (EAS) events in which independent particles hit the two scintillator tiles of a detector station and produce a signal that mimics the timing associated with an upward-moving shower particle? The three groups will work on building a library of tau-neutrino interactions and air shower development to use in building the multivariate likelihood scheme needed to go from shower profile and composition information back to parent neutrino energy and angle. Finally, there will be efforts to develop more cost-effective methods to handle the readout and waveform digitization. All these steps are crucial to the ultimate goal of constructing TAUWER as a premiere Neutrino Astronomy (NA) telescope to complement and extend the work now underway at IceCube and Auger.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Ultrahigh-energy cosmic neutrinos potentially open the way to understanding the acceleration mechanisms in Active Galactic Nuclei and other black-hole related sources distributed throughout the space-time continuum of our universe. The successful implementation and operation of TAUWER will have broad impact on black hole cosmology and on the fundamental question of the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays, one of the fundamental questions of our time.|2

A second part deals with the weak interaction physics required for understanding the lepton distributions produced by supernovae explosions. The shock wave re-heating problem will be studied together with the effects of allowing conversion between different types of neutrinos. The QCD quark-gluon plasma phase is a new form of matter predicted by our current theoretical understanding of the strong interaction. It is conjectured to have existed at the earliest moments of the big-bang creation of the universe. Supernovae are the pressure cookers which produce the nuclear matter in the universe but their mechanisms are not fully understood.

Two projects involving heavy quarkonium decays are planned. First, motivated by the large QCD one-loop corrections to the decay into a Higgs boson, it is planned to calculate the one-loop corrections due to Higgs bosons to this process in two-Higgs doublet models (as required, for example, in all supersymmetric theories). Secondly, it is proposed that heavy quarkonium decays into Z and ZH final states be reexamined for all S- and P-states. It is also planned that the study of W and Z pair- production in high-energy e e collisions in the context of a strongly-interacting electroweak sector be udertaken. Limits on the masses and couplings of leptoquark bosons derivable from ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray neutrino interactions will be investigated as will the phenomenology of superstring-motivated models derived from E . On the more theoretical side, building on previous studies (of this author and collaborators), continued work on the effects of a finite-temperature heat bath on the stability of spacetime is planned. Finally, two projects involving properties of theories with unbroken supersymmetry are also proposed. One is the investigation of sum rules in supersymmetric quantum mechanics and their relation to special function theory in mathematics. The other will involve one-loop calculations of various cross-sections to test for the existence of amplitude zeros beyond tree level in supersymmetric theories. This work, by a very highly-regarded young theoretical physicist, will add to our understanding of the physics of certain elementary particles that, while so-far undiscovered, are widely believed to exist, and are central to our picture of the basic forces of nature.|2

In doing so, RSVP will seek answers to three of the most compelling questions in particle physics: What new particles and fundamental interactions exist beyond the highest energies achievable with the highest energy colliders; what is the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe; and is the degree of CP (charge-parity) symmetry breaking in the K meson and B meson systems the same, as predicted by the SM.<br/><br/>The RSVP project will deploy two types of measurement toward these ends, both of which utilize intense proton beams (provided by the Brookhaven National Laboratory Alternating Gradient Synchrotron) that enable the search for extremely rare processes at a ""sensitivity frontier"", thus complementing the traditional approach of searching for new particles at the ""energy frontier."" One approach will search for the direct conversion of a muon into an electron, a process that becomes possible in theories of physics beyond the SM. This subproject is called MECO for ""Muon to Electron Conversion."" This transition violates lepton flavor conservation and is strictly forbidden in the SM. MECO will observe this process even if only one in 1016 of the muons undergoes the transition, a sensitivity that is more than one thousand times better than previous measurements. If no muon-to-electron conversion is observed at this sensitivity, some of the leading supersymmetric models for physics beyond the SM would be ruled out. Thus, even a negative result would be of great importance.<br/><br/>The second approach employed in RSVP is to observe CP (charge-parity) symmetry breaking in the decay of the long-lived neutral kaon (K0) to a neutral pion (p0), a neutrino, and an anti-neutrino (KOPIO). Only one in 40 billion kaons are expected to decay in this manner. KOPIO is one hundred thousand times more sensitive than previous measurements. A measurement of CP violation in this system will complement and greatly strengthen the many analyses of CP violation in B mesons being conducted in other major experiments around the world. Any difference between CP violation in the K and B mesons would also signal physics beyond the SM. In another important context, the violation of CP symmetry is required to understand the evolution of the early universe into the present matter-dominated universe. <br/><br/>Education and Outreach:<br/>KOPIO and MECO are state-of-the-art experiments that address important questions at the frontiers of physics. The potential to leverage RSVP to enhance education at the K-16 levels, to stimulate public interest in science, and to involve underrepresented groups is high. Planning for education and outreach activities is part of the scope of this award."|2

Cuoricino is a prototype for CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) and is currently the largest operating cryogenic bolometer and neutrinoless double beta decay experiment in the world producing competitive results. The observation of neutrinoless beta decays would indicate that neutrinos are Majorana fermions and, therefore, are their own anti-particles.

The primary objective will be to write and utilize software to obtain nuclear spectra from the raw data recorded by the Cuoricino detector and extract physics information such as the double beta decay lifetime limit. If successful, this will benefit the students as well as the collaboration by providing an alternative analysis effort to examine the results and help refine existing and developing software packages being written for Cuoricino. <br/><br/>It is planned that undergraduate students will also have the opportunity to participate in hands-on Cuoricino shift activity at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in Assergi, Italy.|2

It also isolates the scale for the effective Majorana neutrino mass, identifying the appropriate neutrino mass hierarchy. <br/><br/>Students will have the exciting opportunity to participate in hands-on CUORE construction at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Assergi, Italy. In addition, they will assist with shift activity with CUORE-0, an intermediate single-tower of CUORE slated to be online by mid-2010, designed to demonstrate background, analysis, and material milestones before full CUORE deployment in 2012. Locally at Cal Poly, students will explore various proposed detector calibration schemes by running GEANT4 simulations, and test these simulations against existing data from Cuoricino, a recently decommissioned prototype of CUORE. They will also write and utilize software to obtain nuclear spectra from the raw data obtained by the earlier Cuoricino detector and help with software development to process CUORE and CUORE-0 data. <br/><br/>Concerning Broader Impacts, experiments such as CUORE bring together many experimental and analytical techniques from low temperature, solid-state, particle, and nuclear physics. Improvements in these technologies may lead to benefits in other areas of science and engineering where they are applied.

This ""dark matter"" is detected dynamically, through its effects on the structuring of galaxies, clusters of galaxies and larger scale structures in the universe. Generic extensions of the standard model of subatomic particles predict the existence of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles which are excellent candidates for the dark matter. These are expected to interact with ordinary matter as rarely as neutrinos and thus be extremely difficult to detect.<br/><br/>The COUPP and PICASSO groups have undertaken the development of new large dark matter detectors derived from the well known bubble chamber technique. Charged particles traversing the superheated fluid in bubble chambers deposit heat which creates small bubbles of gas. These bubbles expand explosively unless the chamber is quickly pressurized. The bubbles can be photographed before pressurization revealing the paths of these particles, so the chamber is an excellent amplifier of tiny particle signals. Both approaches have made the superheated state long lived enough to search for dark matter. This award will enable this group to continue its participation in these efforts. The sound sensors already produced by IUSB have recently proven to be useful for discarding cosmic ray induced events and distinguishing the only radioactive signal of concern for moderately superheated fluids (alpha particles). <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the program include enhancing the education of undergraduates.

Most neutrinos passing through the Earth emanate from the Sun, and more than 50 trillion solar electron neutrinos pass through the human body every second.

This will be the most precise determination to date, by an order of magnitude, of the rate for any two-nucleon weak-interaction process.

The Muon g-2 experiment will measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon to a precision of 0.15 parts per million (ppm), a substantial improvement from the 0.5 ppm that has been achieved in previous measurements. The current result disagrees with the prediction of the Standard Model by more than three standard deviations: enough to hint at the possibility of ""new physics,'' but not yet enough to claim a discovery. This is one of a very small number of observables that cannot be understood in the context of the current Standard Model, and it provides an important constraint on extensions to it. The Regis group's initial responsibility will be to test, refurbish, and modernize the scintillating fiber beam monitors that are used to record the dynamic motion of the beam.<br/><br/>The Muon g-2 experiment has the potential to uncover entirely new particles and interactions, perhaps even before they can be directly observed in experiments at the energy frontier.

The experiment involves an investigation of the KARMEN timing anomaly and a search for neutral heavy leptons, sterile neutrinos and neutral supersymmetric and axion-like particles. The KARMEN anomaly is an excess of neutrino events detected in the KARMEN experiment at the ISIS spallation neutron facility at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and may be due to a rare non-Standard Model p+ decay mode: m+Q0 where Q0 denotes a massive, neutral, weakly interacting unstable particle. The study of the anomaly requires a comprehensive investigation of possible background contributions, the main component of the proposed work of the Bucknell group.

CP violation is believed to play an important role in baryogenesis and the observed matter-anti-matter asymmetry in the universe, but the currently known source of CP violation in the standard model is not large enough to account for our matter-dominated universe. Thus it is very plausible that new and much larger sources of CP violation must occur in physics beyond the standard model. B-decays are an excellent play to search for such effects because B-factories and the Tevatron are producing vast amounts of data, and eventually LHC will do likewise. In addition, the two- and three-body decays of B-mesons provide numerous correlations which may violate CP. The PI will develop signatures for particular models of BSM physics, especially the ""little Higgs"" models. <br/><br/>The PI, a professor at an undergraduate university in central Indiana, has a long term interest in weak interations in neutrino physics as well as B-decays,subjects which are well suited as introductions to research at the frontiers of particle physics.

However many fundamental questions are not addressed in the standard model and the standard model does not incorporate the fact that the neutrino, the lightest particle of spin 1/2, has a small mass. Two candidates for explaining some of the puzzles that exist are extending the standard model by doubling the number of particles via using a Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, which adds a particle of integer spin to every particle of 1/2 integer spin. Thus associated with the electron, which has spin 1/2, would be a scalar particle (0 spin) called the selectron. (This particle has not yet been found). Another approach is to assume our world is a lower dimensional surface (or membrane) in a higher dimensional space. This proposal by two groups, one at the Bartol Research Institute led by Qaisir Shafi and one at the Center for Theoretical Physics at the British University in Cairo, Dr. S. Khalil is to enable four Scientists from each institution to visit the other institution each year in order to foster their collaborative research on Large Hadron Collider related physics. As further ""glue"" for the collaboration the proposal is for a Post-doc to be hired at the Center for Theoretical Physics to work full time on the proposed project. The two teams will investigate both types of extensions of the standard model. This investigation is very important because next year at CERN in Geneva Switzerland, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will start operation and will hopefully find new phenomena that will suggest what the extensions of the Standard Model should be. Other ways of accessing the highest energies come from astrophysical observation of the cosmic background radiation, and by understanding the cosmological implications of extensions of the standard model. More specifically, this group of scientists intends to investigate supersymmetric extensions of the SM and their potential signatures at colliders, in Astrophysical observations and cosmological implications. In particular they intend to study the question of whether Supersymmetry can significantly modify the CP asymmetry in B-decays compared to the SM picture. They also plan to perform a complete analysis for the minimal extension of the SM gauge symmetry that can accommodate the phenomenon of neutrino flavor oscillations, which has been confirmed by many experiments. The broader implications of this are many. The exchange of students will be an excellent cross-cultural experience for the students. Scientists trained in different cultures often have different ways of approaching solving a problem. The training of a young post-doc in Egypt who will interact strongly with the American scientists involved will enhance the training of this person and strengthen High Energy Physics research in Egypt. The partnership between the Physicists at Bartol and the Center for theoretical physics has been very fruitful in the past and its continuation would be very fruitful for advances in the field. This project is being supported by the U.S. Egypt Joint Board for Science and Technology which is funding both the U.S. and Egyptian sides of the collaboration."|2

Determining whether neutrinos are Majorana or Dirac particles and measuring their masses are among the highest priorities in neutrino physics, as was pointed out in the APS Multi-Divisional Neutrino Study. The answer will also have important implications for astrophysics and cosmology.<br/><br/>This project has two complementary parts. First is the development of the next-generation CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) detector, including the operations of the first production tower (CUORE-0) and the subsequent data analysis. CUORE promises to be one of the most sensitive NDBD experiments in the next decade. It will be sensitive to the neutrino mass values suggested by recent atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiments in the so-called inverted mass hierarchy. The second goal is the R&D towards a large generic bolometer-based NDBD detector. They will establish a low-background cryogenic facility near the UC Berkeley campus and start a comprehensive program of bolometric detector development. This long-range program will be geared toward a 1 ton-scale, modular detector.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the program includes providing an educational and research environment for the junior scientists, including graduate and undergraduate students.

Most researchers now believe that this is more a consequence of neutrino physics and explain the deficiency as a consequence of the transformation of electron neutrinos into muon or tau neutrinos as they fly out of the center of the Sun. Since the Sun's structure is very stable, the flux of neutrinos should be constant. But in arguments that are addressed in this award, the PI and his collaborators believe that magnetic fields may play an important part. In recent papers, they point out that, if the neutrino has a very small magnetic moment, then the magnetic field of the sun, which is not distributed isotropically, could modulate the neutron flux by converting left-handed neutrinos into right-handed neutrinos which would not be registered by terrestrial detectors. The PI and his team support their theory by claiming that the neutrino flux from the Sun varies with a period close to the rotation period of the deep convection zone. The evidence comes from a sophisticated analysis of existing Homestake and GALLEX-GNO data. There are many critics of this analysis. The principal effort made in this award will be to address the critics by reviewing previous analyses and to make preparations for the study of the Super-Kamiokande data and other data sets, as they become available.<br/>***"|2

Neutrino oscillations, coupled with the MSW mechanism, are required to explain the observed neutrino fluxes at Earth. This solution allows an interesting region between vacuum- and matter-enhanced oscillations where additional new physics can be probed. Likewise, recent solar abundance measurements have created conflicts between the Standard Solar Model and helioseismology results, which are most sensitively resolved by measurement of the CNO neutrino flux. Significantly, there also remains the question whether the luminosity of the sun, as determined by photons, accurately matches the luminosity as determined by neutrinos. In this case, a direct measurement of the pp neutrinos is also required. <br/><br/>This award will provide funding for this group to continue their participation in the science arena of Borexino in the underground laboratory at Gran Sasso, Italy as the collaboration focuses on measuring the Beryllium-7 neutrino flux. The group actively participated and provided expert manpower to Borexino purification efforts.

It detects energetic charged particles (mostly electrons) which are produced in the upper atmosphere by cosmic rays. The experiment has several goals, the most important of which is to determine the elemental composition of the primary cosmic rays at energies above approximately 100 TeV. In order to do this SPASE works in coincidence with the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA), which has several hundred optical detectors so deep in the ice sheet that the only products of the cosmic ray interactions which can be seen by AMANDA are muons. The ratio of muons to electrons produced in a cosmic ray shower is a sensitive function of the mass of the original primary cosmic ray. Since SPASE can measure the number of electrons produced by a cosmic ray as well as its total energy, and AMANDA can determine the number of muons, the mass of an incident primary cosmic ray can be determined. The determination of the elemental composition of cosmic rays is one of the most important outstanding questions in cosmic ray physics and such information will shed light on the origin of energetic cosmic rays. This project is cooperative with the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. ***|2

Spase was first installed at South Pole in late 1987 and has operated almost continuously since then with several improvements. The experiment is intended to search for sources of gamma rays with the expectation that such sources would also be the long sought sources of charged cosmic rays. In the first 5 years of operation SPASE has not found an unambiguous constant source, though there is a candidate. There are also candidate pulsed sources which may have been detected. These results are consistent with all similar experiment in the Southern Hemisphere. It is planned to operate SPASE in conjunction with the new detectors which are being installed as part of the AMANDA (Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array). These new detectors will provide additional information on the muon content of the air showers and therefore reduce the charged cosmic ray background and increase the likelihood of detection of gamma rays.|2

The ideas in this direction that have been pursued most forcefully are superstring theory and noncommutative geometry. These two approaches are intimately related. Noncommutative geometry has provided a new framework to study spaces which could not be handled by the standard methods of Riemannian geometry. It offered a new perspective in the study of gauge theories and the role of the Higgs field and is a promising candidate to describe geometries at Planckian energies. In the past years it has been established that space-time is approximated by a well defined product of a continuous four-dimensional manifold by a finite dimensional space. The main focus of this program is to construct a genuinely noncommutative finite dimensional space valid at sub-planckian scales and whose limit at lower energies is the noncommutative space of the standard model. The geometry will be reduced to those of almost commuting matrices, and it will be possible to get a handle on quantizing the geometry. It will also study new asymptotic limits of the spectral action as well as cosmological implications. Other parts of this project will study various aspects of gravity such as stability of BPS monopoles, and formulation of consistent massive theories of gravity, implications of the presence of right-handed neutrinos on the geometry of spacetime, the behavior of spectral actions in the presence of singularities and non-perturbative evolution of the dynamical fields at scales of the order of the Planck length. <br/>Broader impact of Project: Due to its interdisciplinary nature, this work which involves research on the frontiers of noncommutative geometry, will be of benefit to both physicists and mathematicians. The new ideas and methods in this proposal will contribute to the knowledge of the high energy theory and phenomenology, quantum gravity and mathematics communities, and to a lesser extent to the astro-physics community. The American University of Beirut (AUB) plays a very important role in promoting the American educational system in the Middle East. Historically, the emphasis was on liberal education. The new aim is to provide in addition a vibrant environment for the promotion of research. The launching of the Ph.D. program in theoretical physics in October 2009 is a step in that direction and is attracting students of high caliber.|2

Notably, the r-process is thought to occur near thecore of a supernova in a fraction of a second, and to synthesize half thenuclei heavier than iron. It occurs in a hot neutron-rich environment, passing through nuclei that are 20 neutrons beyond stability. One componentof the research will be to measure half-lives and structure of nuclei along the r-process path, thus greatly improving our understanding of ther-process. Another process, the p-process, occurs in a high-temperature<br/>hydrogen-rich environment in tens of seconds, as matter from one star is accreted onto either a white dwarf or neutron star companion. The result can be a nova or an x-ray burst. This process proceeds by successive proton-capturenreactions and beta-decays through nuclei a few protons to the proton-rich side of stability, but has critical points at which it may require a beta-decay in order to proceed unless the next reaction proceeds very rapidly. Thus it is important to measure proton-capture reaction rates on the unstable nuclei along its pathway in order to understand how it synthesizes nuclei and generates energy. We plan to study several crucial p-process reactions. The final component of the program involves the Observatory for Multiflavor NeutrInos from Supernovae. OMNIS will detect several thousand events, mostly from ""e-neutrinos"", from the next galactic supernova. But, because of ""neutrino oscillations"" recently established by the Super-K and SNO neutrino observatories, these will actually reflect the energy distributions of the more-difficult-to-detect mu- and tau-neutrinos just as they emerge from the very core of the exploding supernova. OMNIS' data will enable a variety of results, ranging from (1) diagnosis of the stellar collapse process at a level that will test for several recently hypothesized effects, (2)direct measurement of neutrino masses several orders of magnitude more accurately than some present results, (3) determination of poorly determined neutrino oscillation modes, (4) observation of the signatures of someprocesses of <br/>nucleosynthesis, and (5) possible observation of the sharp neutrino luminosity termination that would signal the collapse to a blackhole."|2

The only exception are such elements as lithium, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, and slightly heavier elements, which may have been formed in trace amounts during the big bang. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to study nucleosynthetic processes in the range of astrophysical environments listed above: in supernovae, novae, X-ray bursts, stellar collisions, and the big bang. In addition, the work will focus on 3-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic modelling of stellar explosions and how the mixing and clumping of matter during such explosions affects nuclear processes, and how the latter affects the former (e.g., by radioactive decay). Particular attention will be paid to neutron capture cross sections for very neutron-rich light nuclei, electron captures on nuclei beyond atomic mass 60, and inelastic neutrino scattering. The topics to be covered are far-ranging. The PI intends to collaborate with Ken Nomoto of Tokyo (supernovae), W. Benz of Harvard (3-D smooth particle code), J. Cowan of the U. of Oklahoma and A.G.W. Cameron of Harvard (r-process scenarios), and J. Applegate of Columbia Univ. (big bang nucleosynthesis). The work is a continuation of research previously funded by NSF.|2

When scattering leptons from nucleons with large momentum transfer the process can be described within perturbative QCD in which the scattering takes place on an asymptotically free quark with a well defined longitudinal momentum distribution. On the other hand, the quarks are confined inside mesons and baryons, and at low momentum transfer it is these composite particles which are the effective degrees of freedom. One focus of this research is on better understanding the transition between these regimes. In particular, this grant will support work on a precision determination of the magnetic elastic form factor of the proton to large momentum transfer to study the transition to perturbative scaling, in addition to a measurement of the F_2 structure function of the proton and deuteron at large Bjorken-x, for which most of the nucleon momentum is carried by a single valence quark. The former experiment will be performed in Jefferson Lab experimental Hall A and the latter in Hall C. <br/><br/>In addition, this research will study the modification of the nucleons in the nuclear medium, for which no generally accepted physics model currently exists. While many studies of the ratio of structure functions measured in nuclei to those on the deuteron have been performed in electron and muon scattering, practically no experimental data exists for neutrino scattering. Such data would provide important tests of models of medium modifications and will be the focus of the upcoming MINERvA medium energy beam run, while the continuing analysis of the successfully concluded low energy run is primarily focused on elastic scattering and resonance production.<br/><br/>From a broader perspective, this project aims to further elucidate the structure of the nuclear constituents of ordinary matter via new experimental data. While, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) has been accepted as the theory of the strong interaction, which is responsible for confining the constituent quarks and gluons into the composite hadrons which make up ordinary matter, many questions of the resulting structure still remain.These studies will be performed with complementary probes via the electromagnetic interaction, utilizing the electron beam at Jefferson Lab, and the weak interaction, utilizing a neutrino beam in the MINERvA experiment at Fermilab.<br/><br/>Both Jefferson Lab experiments are expected to be among the first performed after the energy upgrade of the accelerator. This will leverage the significant expertise of this group to the commissioning of both Hall A and Hall C in support of these experiments, which will also broadly support the larger Jefferson Lab nuclear physics program. It is expected that this research program will also address a critical need in the training of the next generation of researchers in physics, where African-Americans and women are both significantly under-represented.|2

Our main goal is to extract information about new particles, for instance the super-partners of quarks (squarks) predicted by the super-symmetric ( SUSY) extension of the Standard Model (SM), by fully taking advantage of the data from B meson experiments (Babar, Belle, LHCb). Being the world highest luminosity machines, these experiments are able to observe extremely rare B decays, in which we would search for manifestations of CP and flavour violations not predicted by SM.In SUSY models, extra sources of CP and flavour violation are introduced through SUSY breaking, which explains the large masses of SUSY particles. Our target is to strictly constrain the flavour structure of the down-type squark mass matrix by using data from B meson experiments. We will proceed our project providing high precision theoretical predictions for B decays, which is most important since new physics effects can be extremely small.The largest difficulties for this purpose come from strong interaction effects, requiring various techniques in quantum chromo-dynamics (QCD). We will carefully incorporate their latest developments, such as QCD factorisation, perturbative QCD method, QCD sum-rule and large Nc expansion (Nc being the number of colours). Actually, CP violation and flavour structure are also intensively studied in the neutrino sector, triggered by the confirmation of massive neutrinos by SuperKamiokande and SNO experiments.It has recently been shown that the observed third and second-generation neutrino oscillations can have an impact on the same generation quarks (bottom to strange) transition, in the framework of SUSY Grand Unified Theory (GUT). We are therefore interested in comparing our results from B physics with SUSY GUT models well motivated by neutrino physics and its implication for Cosmology.|2

It is believed that such environments produce the enigmatic ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), with energies beyond 10-20 eV. The Pierre Auger Observatory (AUGER), a state-of-the-art hybrid detector under development in Argentina with significant European contribution, allows the detection of both neutrinos and UHECRs with energies above 10-17-10-18 eV with unprecedented sensitivity.   To make the most of this multi-messenger instrument and efficiently constrain the relevant high-energy astrophysical models, it is required to study in detail the detector's response to (nearly) horizontal air showers (HAS), which allow an unambiguous identification of neutrino-induced showers and could promote AUGER to the first neutrino detector at those highest energies. This will be made possible thanks to direct experiments with inclined muons crossing the replica of an AUGER detector available at IPNO, checked against offline detector simulations.   The derivation of the primary neutrino flux requires a detailed study of the AUGER sensitivity to HAS, which will also result in a significant extension of the effective AUGER field of view, and thus a larger acceptance and sky coverage. The raw data will be interpreted in the light of up-to-date astrophysical and cosmological models, taking advantage of the applicants' expertise in neutrino phenomenology and particle physics beyond the Standard Model, and compared to available information provided by other neutrino detectors around the world. Hypothesis on the production and propagation mechanisms of those high-energy neutrinos will be tested and related to UHECR phenomenology, hopefully answering some of the questions raised by cosmic particles at the very end of the energy spectrum.|2

One of the unexpected results in particle physics during the last decade has been the discovery that neutrinos have mass, that they have the ability to change from one species to another as they travel through space or matter, and that the extent of these transformations (mixing angles) is surprisingly large. Neutrinos are fundamental constituents of our universe and, together with photons are the most numerous. Yet, neutrinos are poorly understood compared to other fundamental constituents and further studies are required to understand many significant issues in cosmology and astrophysics, to probe physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, and to resolve the mystery of matter-antimatter asymmetry in our universe. The proposed program consists of the MINOS experiment and planning for an off-axis neutrino experiment with the neutrino beam currently being completed at Fermilab. The MINOS experiment is in its final stages of construction. The far detector of MINOS, located in the Soudan Mine in northern Minnesota was completed in August 2003 and has begun taking data on cosmic rays. The neutrino beam and other related construction efforts at Fermilab are expected to be complete by the end of 2004 and data taking with accelerator neutrinos should commence shortly thereafter. The MINOS experiment will significantly improve our knowledge of neutrino oscillation parameters in the atmospheric neutrino energy region; will search for subdominant oscillation modes into electron and/or sterile neutrinos; and will observe oscillatory behavior of muon neutrino disappearance, thus providing a conclusive test of the oscillation origin of that phenomenon. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the research will occur at several levels: (a) Understanding how matter is constructed and how the forces of nature shape it into the myriad observed forms is a long standing question that resonates with scientists and non-scientists alike; (b) The research program poses a set of questions through which students and postdoctoral fellows will learn not only to frame crisp tests of the fundamental construction of matter, but also to devise innovative methods and tools for conducting them. Attacking such problems provides the rigorously educated young people that our society desperately needs; and (c) the proposal includes elements of outreach to the broader community.|2

The AP field studies the origins and structure of the universe by measuring radiation impinging on the earth from outer space. The measurement of this radiation gives information about AP and EPP.|2

It was the first disagreement with the Standard Model and it may well lead to a deeper understanding of why our world is the way it is. The program consists of two experiments, MINOS and NOvA. MINOS is a mature experiment, slated to take data at most for two more years. On the other hand, the civil construction for NOvA has just started and data taking will not start before the end of 2012. Both experiments utilize the NuMI neutrino beam line at Fermilab. The MINOS detector is located underground in a former iron mine in Soudan, MN, and is located 735 km from Fermilab. <br/><br/>The most exiting possibility in the field is the question of CP violation. If CP is violated in neutrino physics, that would make more likely the hypothesis of leptogenesis, the scheme which might explain the preponderance of matter over antimatter in our universe and thus explain how is it that we exist. The impact of these studies extends beyond particle physics. The intellectual content of these investigations is such that it excites the public-at-large and especially the young people. Many young people are drawn to science because it can answer fundamental questions like the origin and eventual fate of the universe. We believe that the neutrinos are fundamental particles; they existed from the very beginning and played an important role in the evolution of today's world. They help shape the lives of the stars and carry away most of the energy in a supernova explosion. Thus neutrino physics studies are closely connected with those in astrophysics and cosmology.<br/><br/>The program will provide training ground for future scientists and engineers; while doing their PhD and post-PhD research, young men and women will learn modern techniques in software and analysis and become familiar with the state of the art instrumentation. It also will have an impact on the local population, many of whom have never been exposed before to science and scientific way of thinking. MINOS already has an active outreach program and NOvA is planning to emulate a lot of it.|2

Very considerable experimental as well as theoretical attention has therefore been focused on their study. These efforts have been intensified by the experiments at two B factories, a tau-charm factory, at hadronic colliders and a comprehensive program to study neutrino oscillations. They led to the first observation of CP violation outside neutral kaons decays and clear evidence for neutrino oscillations. The next step which is the core of this proposal is to have a precise analysis methodology that will allow one to extract of the numerical values of the fundamental parameters that drive CP violation in various systems,<br/>rare decays and neutrino oscillations, namely quark masses, quark and lepton mixing parameters. The theoretical framework for this analysis is the Heavy Quark Expansion, where transition rates are described by an expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass. This is now at the stage of development where it is possible to attempt to determine SM quark parameters from data with a theoretical uncertainty not exceeding the very few percent level. To achieve such a goal one has to subject a judiciously chosen host of data to a careful quantitative theoretical analysis with a high degree of internal redundancy. One actually hopes to find inconsistencies with the predictions from the SM, which would constitute manifestations of New Physics beyond the SM.|2

The topics to be covered are at the forefront of research topics in particle and nuclear physics and will explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. The study of neutrino physics and dark matter is of high interest to particle and nuclear physicists and astrophysicists. The ongoing and proposed dark matter and neutrino experiments are expected to unveil the answers to critical questions asked by scientists for last few decades. Recent precise measurements of all the neutrino mixing angles necessitate a theoretical roadmap for the future. Understanding the nature of dark matter better would help to understand the composition of the cosmos better. <br/><br/>The scope of the 2012 summer CETUP* program will include the ""Dark Matter"" program followed by a three day interlude program (July 19-21) comprising of ""Dark Matter, Neutrino Physics and Unification."" Following that, there will be a week and a half long focused theory session on ""Neutrino Physics and Unification"" and a 3-day long Physics Working Group workshop of Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) (July 30 - August 1).<br/><br/>Among the Broader Impacts, understanding neutrino properties better could have significant implications in astrophysics and cosmology, and may offer solutions to the current puzzles such as the abundance of matter over antimatter in the Universe. Outreach efforts will aim to share the excitement of this research with K-12 students and general public. Selected CETUP* participants will give three public lectures that outline the importance of dark matter and neutrino research. Such presentations at a level comprehensible by the general public are important for developing public support for national investment in basic science. South Dakota Public Broadcasting will record and stream the lectures state wide as well as post it on their website for those who couldn't participate live. They also will be working with the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation to reach out to Native American students and include them in the educational activities at the CETUP* as well as organize an informal get together with the students and discuss their interests in science and possible future STEM career opportunities."|2

Motivated by the great interest and excitement over the recent improved WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) search limits from CDMS-II, the collaboration is considering ways to explore substantially greater regions of possible WIMP cross sections. It is clear that there is substantial scientific interest in mounting experiments with an eventual sensitivity reach more than a factor of a thousand beyond the current limits, a level that would test much of the theoretically allowed parameter space. Some of this will be achieved with continued running of CDMS-II, but that will become background limited before it can reach the desired level. However, the CDMS-II technology is capable of reaching this level of sensitivity with a substantial increase in mass, reduction in background events, and relocation to a deeper underground site.<br/><br/>With continued development efforts in detector fabrication and testing, and a coordinated program aimed at background identification and reduction, an experiment with 25 kg of detector mass could be operational by 2008. The cryogenics system of this experiment would be planned to allow further expansion, so that additional improvements in mass production and testing of detectors could yield a phased increase in detector mass up to 1000 kg.<br/><br/>The CDMS-II collaboration proposes to continue running that apparatus to the end of 2006 to obtain the best limit achievable with that apparatus. Concurrently, a detector R&D project will proceed to develop SuperCDMS, the 25 kg detector, to be housed in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory Laboratory in Canada. This individual proposal from the University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center represents a request for support of the PI's long-term development of cryogenic electronics systems for improved detector technology and increased sensitivity. There are three aspects to the long-term work: 2-stage superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) pre-amplifier development, SQUID charge-readout development, and dissemination of SQUID operational expertise to collaborating groups.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this proposed long-term activity is a) development of improved dark-matter detectors and systems, b) increased collaboration between cooperating NSF institutions, and c) broad support of an enabling technology (SQUIDs) which is important to a number of additional scientific programs, including novel SQUID devices and electronics development.<br/><br/>The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include a) undergraduate education in a non-traditional student population and b) interactions between those students and graduate students and post-docs at from other institutions, encouraging consideration of graduate education by these students science and engineering fields in which they are generally under-represented.|2

The science that could be enabled by this R&D includes programs at DUSEL, the proposed Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory in South Dakota.<br/><br/>Project X is a collection of experiments proposed to compose a future Fermilab program. A component of such a program is likely to consist of measurements of neutrino properties. Physicists now think that neutrinos could provide answers to some of the puzzling questions not addressed by the Standard Model. In particular, physicists think that neutrinos might be the reason that we exist: their interactions could explain why matter is abundant while antimatter disappeared in our universe. The proposed Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment aims to find out whether that is the case. It will explore the interactions and transformations of the world's highest-intensity (made possible through SRF R&D) neutrino beam by sending it from Fermilab more than 1,000 kilometers straight through the earth to the largest particle detectors ever built. The detectors could be housed in the proposed DUSEL laboratory.<br/><br/>Superconducting radiofrequency is a key enabling technology for state-of-the-art particle accelerators. It is of critical importance to Fermilab 's Project-X, future Linear Colliders, and to future accelerators for high-energy and nuclear physics as well as next-generation light sources such as those based on energy-recovery linacs and free-electron lasers. SRF applications cover a very broad range of accelerator and beam parameters; cost savings in SRF can determine the feasibility of a particular design or whether a project is funded at all. Small improvements in achievable SRF cavity performance can lead to significant reductions in construction and operating costs of major accelerator-based facilities. The basic physics and chemistry governing SRF cavity limits and behavior at the niobium surface is still insufficiently understood, and it is still impossible to guarantee that a particular cavity fabricated and processed according to a particular recipe will actually meet its specifications. No US vendors can match European or Asian vendors in cavity quality, achievable gradient, or production reproducibility. US industry on its own cannot undertake the necessary R&D. Intellectual and practical mentorship of US industry by university and laboratory experts is a step on a path that American industry can follow to help it regain leadership in many specialized high-tech areas, including SRF.<br/><br/>The frontiers of science are often shaped by accelerator physics and technology. As examples, SRF has opened up a new world in nuclear physics and neutron production; the short x-ray pulses from free electron lasers will revolutionize atomic and molecular physics, and accelerator science will determine the future of its progenitor, particle physics, where inventions are needed to overcome size and cost limitations.<br/><br/>This collaboration is positioned to make substantial progress in understanding, improving, and detailing the important steps in fabricating and processing cavities. The US vendors who become partners in this program will benefit in that they can begin to learn how to successfully compete with the rest of the world on US and international cavity procurements. It is also worth noting that accelerator science is a very forward-looking area for a young scientist to pursue.|2

This large future scientific project could be sited at an existing U.S. laboratory. MICE is an essential step towards this goal and will validate Neutrino Factory cost estimates by confirming the feasibility and performance of the key ""muon cooling"" technique. <br/><br/>Neutrinos were originally postulated as massless neutral particles emitted during beta decay of radioactive nuclei. When they were found to come in two (and, later, three) types, each type was assumed (based on observation) to be immutable. However, recent experimental results indicate that over sufficiently long distances, neutrinos oscillate from one kind into another. From this, it follows that neutrinos have nonzero masses. This discovery raises fundamental issues regarding the total amount of matter in the universe and the origin of the excess of matter over antimatter, and places a high priority on studies to deduce the parameters of neutrino oscillation, including possible Charge conjugation-Parity (CP) violation in neutrino mixing. Although neutrino-oscillation studies using accelerator-derived neutrino beams are now planned or under way, recent world-wide R&D work points to a Neutrino Factory, producing a novel neutrino beam via decay of an intense muon beam circulating in a storage ring, as the ideal tool for neutrino oscillation and CP-violation studies. Such a tool would permit sensitivity several orders of magnitude beyond that of current and planned experiments. A Neutrino Factory would also be the first step towards muon-muon colliders in the longer term, with unique potential for studies of lepton collisions at the postulated Higgs resonance and the energy frontier. Muon beams at the required intensity can only be produced into a large phase space, but affordable existing acceleration technologies require a small input beam. This mismatch could be alleviated by ""cooling"" the muon beam to reduce its size. This is the goal of MICE and an international collaboration has been organized to carry it out. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of this research include validation of an important new technique applicable in a variety of scientific and technological areas, including particle physics and cosmology; development of next-generation instrumentation; collaboration of interdisciplinary and international university and national-laboratory groups including accelerator and particle physicists and engineers; training of graduate and undergraduate students including those from community colleges and underrepresented minorities; and wide information dissemination via outreach activities and public media."|2

Neutrino astronomy has, to date, been limited to detection of solar neutrinos and one brief burst from a supernova which appeared in the Large Magellanic Cloud in February 1987. Very recently several new sources of high energy gamma rays, which may also be neutrino sources, have been discovered by the Compton Observatory satellite and, most significantly, the atmospheric Cherenkov telescope on Mt. Hopkins, AZ. There should also be many detectable neutrino sources which are not detectable by gamma rays, or any other wavelength of electromagnetic radiation, because of intervening matter.

The detector is being constructed between 1,400 and 2,100 meters below the surface by melting holes into the ice with a hot water drill and then freezing in long stings of widely space photomultiplier tubes. On the rare occasions when very penetrating upward going neutrinos, which have passed through the bulk of the Earth, interact in the ice, producing charged particles, the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA), detects the resulting flash of light, from which the energy and direction of flight of the original neutrino can be deduced. The present detector has eight string in place, and this award will provide the manpower necessary to expand AMANDA to 20 strings and to analyze the resulting data. AMANDA is a collaboration of the University of Wisconsin (this award), the Universities of California at Berkeley and Irvine, the Universities of Stockholm and Uppsula (Sweden), and DESY (Germany). The institutions other than Wisconsin are funded through different channels.

Neutrinos produced by galactic or extra-galactic sources travel undeviated to the earth, bringing information about the astrophysical processes that cannot be inferred from studying electomagnetic radiation. Muons and neutrinos are also produced by cosmic ray interactions with air nuclei in the earth's atmosphere. At high energies, charmed particle production and decay in the atmosphere is the dominant terrestrial source of fluxes of muons and neutrinos. A new calculation of the fluxes of muon and neutrinos from the decays of charmed particles that are produced in the atmosphere will be performed using a range of inputs consistent with laboratory measurements of charm production, extrapolated to higher energy. In addition, calculations related to the interpretation of electron neutrino and muon neutrino conversions to charged particles in underground detectors will be refined. The improvements to existing calculations may have an impact on the allowed regions of parameter space in models with neutrino oscillations. A `Monte Carlo` simulation of neutrino production of charm quarks in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) will be developed. QCD is the theoretical description of the strong nuclear force. The Monte Carlo will be used by experimental groups to help them determine strange quark content of the proton.|2

The theories of nuclear systems being developed will be capable of unifying all available data from present and future experiments at facilities including the Continuous Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF), National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory(NCSL), the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC), and the proposed Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA). Among the works are basic studies of nuclear forces, currents, structure and reactions, properties of nuclear matter, and nucleon and hadron structure. A major focus is on understanding new states of matter that are formed under extreme conditions of temperatures and pressures, e.g., quark gluon plasmas formed in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions, including color superconductivity and its consequences. Nuclear processes and properties underly the structure and evolution of stars. The present program applies nuclear theory to neutron stars, nuclear reactions in the cosmos, and supernovae, with the aim of explaining observations and using observations to learn properties of matter under extreme conditions. Research on neutron stars includes the structure of the crust, equation of state and superfluid properties of cold nuclear matter, possible transition to quark matter cores, including droplet and novel superconducting phases. Production, absorption, and scattering rates of neutrinos in hot and dense nuclear matter are studied along with the equation of state and composition. <br/>The strong theoretical connections between nuclear systems and condensed matter systems allow important cross-fertilization between these areas. The condensed matter part of this program continues a long-standing complementary effort to gain theoretical understanding of unusual states of matter. Topics currently being studied include Bose-Einstein condensation in magnetically trapped atomic systems, including states at high rotation, and correlation effects arising from interactions between particles. <br/><br/>Broader Impact <br/>Understanding how nuclear processes and properties govern the evolution of galaxies and the energy generation in stars, including our sun, is an essential step in describing the universe in which we live. The nuclear world operates on length scales a million times smaller than that of the atomic world, and thus provides a deeper view of the structure of matter in the universe. A crucial aspect of this program is to bring out the ways in which underlying interactions between constituents of systems on scales from nuclear to condensed matter to astrophysical govern the system's structure and dynamics. The nuclear and condensed matter systems being studied are very unusual many-body systems that provide unique intellectual insights. <br/>A vital component of this research program is its active tradition of training students and postdoctoral researchers. The group attracts able students and postdocs who, through the broad training they receive and their intimate involvement in the research of the group, develop the ability to combine nuclear, particle, astro and condensed matter physics research on forefront problems. The young scientists trained in this program generally go on to have significant impact in research at universities and <br/>national laboratories.|2

String theory is an attempt to move beyond the quantum mechanical description of elementary particles as point like particles to a formulation of them as excitations of a microscopic string-like object. These excitations would include not only quarks, gluons, leptons etc., but also the graviton, the quantum excitation of gravity so that one would have a truly unified theory. The ultimate aim of this research is a better and deeper understanding of space-time and a quantum theory of gravity. The interior of the sun is cooled by the emission of neutrinos whose interactions are so weak that they can escape from the surface. By studying the detailed properties of these neutrinos, as seen in terrestrial detectors, one learns about neutrino properties and about the interior of the sun. ***|2

Nonetheless, many aspects of the Standard Model remain mysterious: What is the origin of the masses of the known elementary particles? What accounts for the hierarchical structure of their mass spectrum? Why is the gravitational force so much weaker than the electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear forces? What is the mysterious dark matter that seems to be pervasive in our universe? Professors Carone, Erlich, and Sher aim to address these and related questions by considering possible physics beyond the Standard Model, including new particles (for example, their proposed work on extended Higgs sectors), new symmetries (for example, their proposed work on models of neutrino masses), and new structures of space-time (for example, their proposed work on higher-dimensional models and holography). It is exciting that much of the work proposed by these principal investigators might be tested at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC, which is the highest energy proton-proton collider in the world, has begun full operations. Data from the LHC is imminent and is likely to lead to nothing less than a new Standard Model for the next generation of particle physicists, i.e., a new theoretical picture of the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions. In addition, the PIs have proposed work on dark matter, mysterious particles that will be studied not only at the LHC, but also at numerous direct detection experiments around the world. The PIs will consider possible models of a ""dark sector"", which may involve fairly light particles with very weak couplings to matter. To study such a sector experimentally, one requires high-intensity particle beams at low energies, and the PIs will consider how these models may be explored using the high-luminosity electron beam at Jefferson Lab. This effort may lead to new connections between the nuclear and high-energy physics communities.<br/><br/>This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professors Carone, Erlich, and Sher will involve graduate students and a postdoc in their research, providing critical training to junior physicists who are beginning research in this field. The postdoc will be jointly funded with Jefferson Lab, and will facilitate a synergy between two different disciplines in physics. The PIs also intend to give public lectures on their research results and involve undergraduate students in their work."|2

The production rates of various types of glueballs at high momentum transfer will be calculated. Another QCD prediction concerns the decays of heavy quark-light quark bound states; all potentially observable two body decays of such systems will be investigated. It has been known for some time that quarks and leptons come in families, and it is known that there are only three light neutrino's; thus the neutrino of a fourth family must be very heavy. As a result, the charged lepton of the fourth family might be very long-lived, with lifetimes ranging from nanoseconds to years. The phenomenological implications of such long-lived leptons will be studied in detail, and the other implications of models which contain such leptons will be studied. Finally, high precision electroweak studies require better knowledge of the cross-section for electron-positron scattering in the 1-9 GeV energy range, and the possibilities of CEBAF making such a measurement in the future will be investigated. e proven leadership than Harris in terms of representing LBL.

This group was formed nearly two decades ago to address a critical need in a science where African-Americans are severely under-represented. Since that time the group has significantly expanded the scientific program, while facilitating the successful careers of a number of minority scientists. The group is recognized for leadership in studies of the structure of the nucleon (proton or neutron), in particular in kinematics where the quarks in the substructure carry a large fraction of the total momentum of the system. Precision measurements of nucleon structure in this regime provide critical information regarding the mysterious transition from a scale where only quarks and gluons matter, to the scale where only nucleons and mesons need to be considered. The group has spearheaded efforts to utilize global data sets for a more comprehensive understanding, and to better model the observed phenomena. The group will continue to focus on electron scattering experiments at the nearby Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, in particular looking in anticipation to the planned energy upgrade of this laboratory. The group will, as well, broaden to focus on the MINERvA experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. This experiment will use the unique properties of neutrinos, which experience only the weak force, as opposed to the electromagnetic probe provided by an electron beam, and carry a neutral charge, as opposed to the negatively charged electrons. Neutrino scattering is a largely uncharted realm in nucleon structure studies, and promises to provide new insights into the quark-gluon structure of the nucleon.

One of the main goals of the ATLAS program is to discover the Higgs partic le which is directly related to the fundamental nature of matter and the basic forces shaping our universe. Efficient identification of all lepton species is crucial at the LHC. The tau-leptons are the most difficult to identify but they can provide unique and important information. Within the frame of the Standard Model (SM) and the Minimal Super-symmetric Standard Model (MSSM) Higgs boson(s) can decay to tau's with significant branching ratios. Hadronically decaying tau's are also very important discovery signature for the Super-symmetry.

Within this project the applicant will develop an algorithm for identification of the hadronically decaying tau's.

Ion traps are versatile instruments, successfully applied at radioactive-beam facilities, which con tribute to our understanding of these nuclear properties, e.g. by measuring nuclear masses and charge radii, studying electron-neutrino correlations in beta-decay, or testing the unitarity of the CKM quark-mixing matrix. One prominent example is the ISOLTR AP Penning trap experiment at ISOLDE/CERN, where masses of over 300 short-lived nuclei have been measured with a relative uncertainty reaching 0.01ppm. Being unique as a fingerprint, these masses contribute to stringent tests of nuclear structure and astro physical models, e.g. concerning new magic numbers or the nucleosynthesis of the elements, and even tests of the Standard Model with respect to weak interaction.The TASMATI project has the objective to enhance the experimental setup and to establish a novel and more versatile research environment at ISOLTRAP.

Since presently many experiments suffer from isobaric and even isomeric contaminants, purification in a trap will allow overcoming this problem. For this purpose a compact tape-station system will be implemented behind the last experimental trap. The second part aims at a better understanding of the nuclear halo systems by laser spectroscopy measurements on Be isotopes (with the highlight: one neutron-halo nucleus 11Be). The cooling, purifying and trapping of these nuclei will improve experimental conditions and reduce errors.

Mathews, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and six colleagues to collaborate with Prof. Ken'ichi Nomoto, University of Tokyo, Japan, and co-workers over a period of two years. They will study mechanisms responsible for the synthesis of the elements which occurs in stellar explosions, including the ""big bang,"" proposed as responsible for the birth of the universe itself. Measurements of the electromagnetic and neutrino spectra associated with the explosion of the well-observed 1987 supernova will be correlated with theoretical models. An additional phase of this research involves the study of a possible inhomogeneity of baryon distribution in the universe, which can also help explain mechanisms of element formation immediately after the initial big bang. The overall purpose of this research is to understand processes involved in the formation of the universe. The many observations of the 1987 supernova will be used in conjunction with today's best theories to obtain a scenario for the origin of our universe, which resulted from the explosive synthesis of particles into nuclei of elements, and subsequent ejection of the synthesized material into the interstellar medium. Contributions to this scenario will also be made by the obtaining of an improved theoretical understanding of the processes of baryon diffusion in the universe, which have long-term implications for the continuing expansion of the universe. This research will bring together workers from Japan and the U.S. who have each developed models for the 1987 supernova, and who will attempt to reconcile their work."|2

The researchers will be undertaking a study of the development of a method of detecting single Ba+-136 ions which are created by rare double beta decay of Xe-136 atoms in liquid xenon. The unique combination of decay and single ion detection technologies is expected to make possible a background-free search for double beta decay in Xe-136. In the long term, a two-orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity is projected. Then it is expected that two-neutrino double beta decay of XE-136 will be observed for the first time and that, with the improved sensitivity for zero-neutrino decay, an electron neutrino mass limit around 0.01 eV may be reached. <br/><br/>This project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The U.S. researchers' expertise is in the area of small optical signals and the Japanese have the nuclear expertise in this area. A positive result for neutrinoless double beta decay would imply new physics beyond the Standard Model and may help explain astrophysical mysteries such as the solar neutrino and cosmic ray neutrino deficits and the composition of dark matter in the universe. This research advances international human resources through the participation of graduate students. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation. <br/>***|2

The co-organizers are Professor David Casper of the University of California at Irvine and Dr. Makoto Sakuda of the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Tsukuba, Japan. The recent discovery of neutrino oscillation represents the first compelling evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model, and has triggered enormous interest in future experiments using intense neutrino sources. Unfortunately, the increased statistical precision afforded by more powerful beams will be of little value without corresponding progress in reducing systematic uncertainties. The very large target masses necessary to detect neutrinos are typically comprised of nuclei (Carbon, Oxygen or Iron), but data on neutrino-nucleus reactions are sparse and the effects of the nuclear target are poorly understood. Moreover, the few-GeV energy regime corresponds to the boundary between quasi-elastic and resonant pion-production processes on one hand, and deep-inelastic scattering on the other, where two qualitatively different pictures of the reaction dynamics must be reconciled. Searches for rare oscillation signals in the K2K, Mini-BOONE and MINOS experiments, as well as possible future studies aimed at probing leptonic CP violation, will rely on an accurate description of exclusive neutrino-nucleus cross-sections at these energies. <br/><br/>As partners in these experiments the U.S. and Japan are at the forefront of the exciting and rapidly evolving field of neutrino physics. This workshop will bring together theorists and experimentalists from the particle and nuclear physics communities to lay the groundwork for future progress in understanding neutrino interactions. They will attempt to confront existing models of neutrino scattering and nuclear physics with available data and synthesize them into a coherent description, which can be applied to planned or proposed experiments. Strategies for gleaning new information from near-term experiments will be explored, as well as the prospects for collaboration on future precision measurements. The project advances international human resources through the participation of a number of graduate students. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation. The researchers plan to publish proceedings of the workshop on their web sites.|2

Emphasis will be placed on theoretical work on these topics which is relevant to understanding X-ray, optical, and pulsar- timing observations, including the superfluidity and equation of state of hadron matter, the role of neutrinos and hot equations of state in neutron star formation and earliest evolution, theories relating to the recent supernova in our galaxy (SN1987A), and mechanisms of cooling and heating neutron stars. Participants in the meeting represent major U.S. and Japanese research groups concerned with the fundamental physics and astrophysics of neutron stars. Seminar co- organizers are Dr. David Pines, Department of Physics and Center for Advanced Study, University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, and Dr. Ryozo Tamagaki, Department of Physics, Kyoto University, Japan. The seminar will take place November 6-10, 1990, in Kyoto, under the auspices of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Science Program. Since the discovery of pulsars and galactic X-ray sources, significant progress has been achieved in the field of neutron star physics. The discovery of Supernova 1987A in our galaxy stimulated much observational and theoretical work in this area, both in the U.S. and Japan. Though various meetings have been held to consider recent observational results, there has been much less opportunity for U.S. and Japanese neutron star theorists to meet and discuss their work relevant to understanding the observations. This seminar is intended to enhance significantly the interaction and exchange of knowledge among the currently most active experts of both countries in this field.|2

The answer to this question will fundamentally shape the future direction of neutrino physics regarding the neutrino mass scale and possible CP violations in the lepton sector. Neutrino-less double beta decay experiments can have broad scientific impact: they are sensitive to the absolute scale of the electron neutrino mass and shed light on the nature of the extension to the Standard Model; furthermore, neutrinos, if they are Majorana and with CP violation, may provide a viable physical process contributing to the matter and anti-matter asymmetry of the Universe. The UCLA group is a member of the CUORE neutrino-less double beta decay experiment at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Assergi, Italy. <br/><br/>The research effort will focus on understanding background sources and detector energy resolutions. They will participate in setting up a tower of CUORE TeO2 crystals and will be involved in the Monte Carlo simulations of the CUORE background and data analysis. In addition, the UCLA group is responsible for testing, installation and commissioning of the CUORE electronics system in collaboration with the University of South Carolina and Milan groups as a part of the CUORE construction project. The electronics performance will be a key aspect contributing to the overall detector capability to advance our experimental determination of the neutrino properties. The corresponding sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass ranges from 50-70 meV, if latest nuclear structure calculations are used.<br/><br/>Among the Broader Impacts: it is an international collaboration between Italy and US scientists; the bolometer and electronics technology will have applications such as nuclear radiation measurements for physics or homeland security or applied sciences; and neutrino physics and the new technology are particularly exciting for undergraduate students.|2

The focus is mainly on dark matter and neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments planned for the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) at Homestake, SD. For the dark matter experiments, DARKSIDE and MAX, BHSU is designing, building, and optimizing a continuous wave custom cavity ring-down spectroscopy (cw-CRDS) system for measuring the level of impurities in argon gas. This is important for the success of the depleted argon-based dark matter detectors. With this award the BHSU group expects to improve upon the sensitivity of commercial CRDS systems by at least an order of magnitude. The BHSU group will setup the facilities needed to clean the ancient lead bricks to be used for shielding the double-beta decay experiment, MAJORANA. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: Every summer the BHSU group involves South Dakota undergraduates in hands-on research. The BHSU QuarkNet Center, established in 2009, is one of the most active QuarkNet Centers in the country. Last year five teachers brought about 30 students to participate in an LHC Masterclass held at Homestake. As the group enters their 4th year, they expect to add about four new teachers to the Center. In addition, the BHSU group is working with representatives from Oglala Lakota College, in an effort to establish the first QuarkNet Center at a Tribal College or University (TCU).|2

Considering the success over the last decade of new colliders at Fermilab, SLAC, CERN, DESY, and that others are due to begin operation this year, collider physics will continue to grow as an important branch of High Energy Physics. The Standard Model of particle physics is generally believed to be incomplete. The investigators will explore phenomenological implications of Physics Beyond the Standard Model for current and future experiments at high energy colliders. Examples include the search for supersymmetry, for Higgs bosons the only Standard Model particle yet to be discovered, as well as the physics of neutrinos whose masses could provide clues to physics at high energy. Professors Sandip Pakvasa and Xerxes Tata of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu will collaborate with physicist, Dr. Rohini Godbole of the University of Bombay and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). All coinvestigators have been actively engaged in phenomenological research for the last several years. This collaboration will allow Godbole to interact with the large experimental group at the University of Hawaii that is involved with experiments at Fermilab in the US, in China and in Japan. Scope: High energy physics is an area of research that has been identified as a thrust area by the Indian Government and is one of tremendous activity and strength among Indian physicists. The research team has particular expertise in the areas of investigation and they have worked effectively in the past. The modest support requested for this project will allow the investigators to renew their collaboration and also strengthen cooperative research betweens the growing community of collider physicists in India and their counterparts in the US. ***|2

Neutrinos provide a unique view of how nature accelerates particles and can clarify the role of hadrons in the astrophysical milieu. With 59 (out of 80) IceCube strings deployed since January 2005, the IceCube collaboration is poised to advance the state-of-the-art by a significant margin. <br/><br/>This award will provide funds to accelerate the advance of the scientific frontier by developing and extending data analysis and simulation tools to search for a diffuse flux of Ultra-High Energy (UHE) neutrinos using the IceCube Observatory. The proposed work will develop event reconstruction code and will investigate new procedures to reconstruct events by taking advantage of the information contained within the complete waveform record. Their proposed research plan includes simulation studies of UHE neutrino events in IceCube using a supercomputer cluster and they have started to investigate the performance at UHE energies. They have been approved for 500,000 cpu hours on the Teragrid clusters. Two years of IceCube data should improve current flux limits by a factor of 4 since little background remains in the UHE analysis. If no signal is found, then the flux limits will be less than any version of the Waxman-Bahcall bound, which implies that cosmic ray accelerators must be less efficient at producing neutrinos. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this proposal provide an outlet for curiosity and imagination driven research by graduate and postdoctoral students who will be given the opportunity to learn about data acquisition electronics, detector simulation, and data processing. Student training is founded on strong mentorship.|2
